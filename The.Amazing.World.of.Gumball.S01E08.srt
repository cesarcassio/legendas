Yes! I did it!

264
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:14,272
Granny jojo, granny jojo!
I did it!
 You did what?

265
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,643
 Anais: I carried your
suitcase up to your room.
 Oh. Well, good for you, dear.

266
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:23,547
[ Choir vocalizes ]
Now bring it back down.
My bus will be here any minute.

267
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,964
 Gumball: [ Laughs ]
I found my happy place!
Hey, two rats eating a kabob!

268
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,300
 Both: Hey, gumball.
 Gumball: I found my happy
place.

269
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,002
 Ah, that's great.
 Good for you, pal.
[ Munch! Munch! Munch! ]

270
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,105
 Gumball: Hey, old guy.
 No, wait! My back!
 Gumball: Whoo-hoo! [ Laughs ]

271
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,375
 Oh, that's so much better.
 Darwin: Hey, old guy.
[ Crack! ]

272
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:56,013
Gumball's found his happy place.
 Darn it.
 Anais, give me a kiss goodbye

273
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,917
and put my bags on the bus.
 Anais: [ Grunts ]
 [ Smooches ]

274
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,087
A little bit faster this time,
please.
 Darwin: Granny jojo!

275
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,991
Gumball's found his happy place!
 That's nice, fish kid.
Now kiss me goodbye.

276
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,995
[ Smooches ]
 Gumball: Granny jojo!
I found my happy place!

277
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,298
 Yeah, whatever.
Now give your granny jojo a kiss
goodbye.

278
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,102
 Gumball: Of course.
 Anais: Gumball, give me a
hand with this bag!

279
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,838
 Gumball: Okay.
