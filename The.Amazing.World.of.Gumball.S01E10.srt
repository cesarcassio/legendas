00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,034
 Gumball: This is even longer
than last time.
 Darwin: Come on, dude.

139
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,836
Let's watch TV.
 Come on, dude.
Let's watch TV.

140
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,306
 Darwin: What was that?
 Nothing.
 Darwin: Oh, okay!

141
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,777
What are you waiting for?
 [ As Darwin ] Oh, okay!
What are you waiting for?

142
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,593
 Everyone, look at your maps!
This is the route we'll be
taking to the picnic area.

143
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:42,067
We go along the path, avoiding
the forest of doom, down the
ravine, avoiding the forest of

144
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,407
doom, along the lake, still
avoiding the forest of doom, and
arrive at the picnic area.

145
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,511
Understood?!
 All: Yes, miss simian.
 Darwin: Did she say "avoid"

146
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,247
or "go through" the forest of
doom?
 Gumball: [ Sighs ]

147
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,051
What would you do without me,
Darwin?
She said "go through" the forest

148
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,354
of doom.
Am i right or am i right,
miss simian?

149
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,459
 Both: Huh?!
They're gone!
 Gumball: don't worry, buddy.

150
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:11,596
Stick with me, and you'll be
just fine.
We'll get to that picnic area

151
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,565
long before they do.

152
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,939
 Darwin: You still got the
map, right?
 Gumball: Of course.

153
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:26,745
I swallowed it, then memorized
it.
 Darwin: Ohhhh. Okay.

154
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:32,016
Wait. How does that work?
 [ Growls ]
[ Whip! ]

155
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,819
 [ Growls ]
[ Whip! ]
 [ Growls ]

156
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:40,625
[ Whip! ]
 Darwin: Hmm.
 Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!

157
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,295
 Gumball: Darwin, you know
what's important in a situation
like this?

158
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:50,135
 Darwin: A map?
 Gumball: [ Laughing ]
[ Sighs ]

159
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:54,139
No. Teamwork.
 Darwin: Oh.
I was gonna say that next.

160
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:58,243
 Gumball: don't worry, buddy.
You're part of<i> my</i> team, and I'm
a born survivor.

161
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,612
 Darwin: I'm glad I'm on your
team.

162
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,413
Hey, little squirrels.

163
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,755
 Gumball: All we have to do to
find our way is to follow
nature's clues.

164
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,858
 Darwin: What clues?
 Gumball: The wind is one
clue.

165
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,930
Listen!
[ Gust! ]
 <i> You're going the wrong way!</i>

166
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,467
 Darwin: What did it tell you?
 Gumball: It said we're going
the right way.

167
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:29,274
 <i> I said "wrong way"!</i>
 Gumball: Yep. Definitely.
This is the way.

168
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,911
 <i> Losers.</i>
[ Bird cries ]
 Darwin: Oh.

169
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:37,148
I guess the wind is wrong.
 Gumball: don't worry.
I shall follow miss simian's

170
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,286
smell!
[ Sniffing ]
 Darwin: [ Sniffing ]

171
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,254
[ Both sniffing ]

172
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,293
 Gumball: [ Muffled ] That
way!
[ Flies buzzing ]

173
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,162
 Gumball: Oh.
 Darwin: It kind of smells a
<i>bit</i> like her.

174
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,432
 Gumball: [ Sighs ]
That's fine.
We shall find our way using the

175
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,835
stars.
 Darwin: But the sun is out.
[ Tink! ]

176
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:02,273
 Gumball: [ Sighs ]
The sun<i> is</i> a star, Darwin.
Let's look directly at it.

177
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,718
 Darwin: There are no words to
express the pain that i feel
right now.

178
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,288
 Gumball: Sure there are.
Aaaaaah!
 Darwin: Aaaaaah!

179
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,257
 Come on. This way.

180
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:27,098
 Both: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

181
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,103
 Darwin: Gumball?
 Gumball: Mm-hmm?
 Darwin: Are we lost?

182
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:38,276
 Gumball: [ Laughing ]
Ohhhh...
Yep.

183
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,380
[ Bird cries ]
 Darwin: So, where do we go
now?

184
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,151
 Gumball: [ Sighs ]
I don't know, dude.
I'm no survivor.

185
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:51,222
I'm just useless.
 Darwin: But we're still
alive.

186
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,793
Hungry, cold, and lost...
But alive!
And we're still a team.

187
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:59,530
I know you can get us out of
here.
Let's have lunch.

188
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:04,702
You'll feel better.
Fish flakes or<i> diet</i> fish flakes?
 Gumball: You're right, buddy!

189
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:09,807
I<i> am</i> a survivor, and i<i> will</i> get
us to the picnic!
 Darwin: Can i have the diet

190
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,477
fish flakes?
 Gumball: You don't want to
eat that.

191
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:16,581
[ Crash! ]
Not when you're in the middle of
nature's supermarket.

192
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,451
 Darwin: What?
 Gumball: [ Sighs ]
Look at this tree, Darwin.

193
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:25,790
It's made from little bits,
which themselves are made from
the smallest bits of all --

194
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,727
circles, circles with other
little circles going around
them.

195
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:36,968
So, since everything is made
from circles, then so is food.
Which means this rock is exactly

196
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,773
the same as a chicken nugget.
So let's eat it!
[ Crunch! ]

197
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,209
[ Sighs ]
 Darwin: Circle nugget tastes
like a rock.

198
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:49,180
 Gumball: don't worry, dude.
There's loads of stuff made of
circles.

199
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:53,618
That's why it's called the
circle of life.
 Darwin: Oh.

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,586
Is that made of circles, too?

201
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,126
 Gumball: Even better than
circles.
It's made of meat!

202
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,430
 Darwin: But we don't have a
weapon.
 Gumball: Hmm...

203
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,199
Hang on, Darwin.
I don't need weapons.
I got claws.

204
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,704
[ Evilly ] I am a predator.
Hear me roar!
Meow!

205
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,274
[ Normal voice ] Let's sneak up
on him.
[ Purrs ]

206
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,242
 Darwin: [ Growls ]

207
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,417
Uh, gumball?
 Gumball: Shh!
 Darwin: I haven't got claws.

208
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,456
 Gumball: Shh!
 Darwin: But i got fins.
I could fish-slap the beautiful

209
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,891
creature.
 Gumball: Shhhh!
Dude!

210
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:39,931
We're trying to sneak up on it!
[ Honk! ]
[ Flies buzzing ]

211
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:45,703
 Darwin: Come on! Get him!
 Gumball: Uh...You first.
 Darwin: Okay.

212
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,207
[ Slap! ]
[ Creak! ]
Can we eat it now?

213
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,513
 Gumball: Whoops!
[ Chuckles nervously ]
[ Pitter! Pitter! Pitter! ]

 [ Growls ]
 Gumball: [ Panting ]

215
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,284
Maybe we should try something
smaller.

216
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,958
 Darwin: Why are we smiling?
Gumball, please, please don't
eat it!

217
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,927
 Gumball: It's him or us,
dude.
We got to eat<i> something.</i>

218
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,433
 Darwin: But look at him!
He's so cute!
 [ Whimpers ]

219
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,375
 Gumball: What was i
thinking?!
I'm sorry, little dude.

220
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,578
Bye-bye!
Cherish your freedom!
 Darwin: Never abandon your

221
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,281
dreams!

life!

 Gumball: Well, it's nature's

226
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,674
way, Darwin.
He was at the bottom of the food
chain.

227
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,812
 Darwin: Who's at the bottom
<i>now?</i>

 Darwin: It's my tummy.

 Gumball: Well, stop it!
You're gonna attract another
predator!

231

 Darwin: But I'm hungry.
 Gumball: Oh, will you<i> please</i>
stop talking about food?

 Anyone for a fourth helping?
 I'll have it!
Oops! I split myself!

[ Stomach growling ]
 Gumball: Ohhh, I'm so hungry!

243
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:24,529
I think I've started to digest
myself.
And there's no food around here

244
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:28,933
for miles!

there is.

you?!

were a team.

 Gumball: Yeah.
 Darwin: And made me chew on a

272
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,695

twisted my ankle, so you're
gonna have to carry me to the

275
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,240

281
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:19,870

 Darwin: Did she say "avoid"
or "go through" the forest of

282
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:20,971
doom?
