You've had it on your feet all day, dude.

[up-tempo music playing]

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Nope.

171
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Don't remember any toilet paper.

172
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,160
So it wasn't Penny, it wasn't Rocky,

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,480
and it wasn't Darwin,

174
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
which leaves us with only one suspect--

175
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
The only person who knew the combination

to the locker

You're coming with me, Watterson!

Wait! You're forgetting one bit
of crucial evidence!

185
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240
And what's that?

186
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll just...

187
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,880
go and get it.

First, Penny hung her hideous painting
on the wall.

[Penny] Hey!

246
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,320

looking love-struck, as usual.

Next, Darwin walked down the stairs,

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,600
trailing toilet paper like a nincompoop.

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,480
[Bobert] And finally came Principal Brown,

257
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,720
whose office door suddenly flew open,

258
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,480
leaving him disoriented and dizzy.

259
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,840
He fell down the stairs,

260
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
rolling himself in Darwin's toilet paper,

261
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
smashed into Penny's artwork,

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,680
covering his face in paint,
then fell back into

263
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,560
Rocky's chemicals, burning off his hair,

264
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
then down more stairs,

265
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,280
wrapping himself
in even more toilet paper,

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
and finally into Gumball's locker.

267
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,040
Huh?

268
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
Eh. [whistling]

269
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,680
But why didn't you say something before?

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
Well, it was so funny, I blew a fuse.

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,400
I was like, "Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha-a-a-a."

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,120
-You've done it again.

274
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,960
So, the true culprit is the person
who threw open

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,280
Principal Brown's door.

And I know just how to find out.

278
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Whoever opened the door, put your hand up!

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
Oh, come on!

280
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,800
Why don't I just replay the tape?

281
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
Stop there!

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Now forward slowly.

283
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,120

We're going to tell Principal Brown!

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Tell him what?

292
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
What we just saw on Bobert's memory.

293
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720

Hmm. I'll check.
