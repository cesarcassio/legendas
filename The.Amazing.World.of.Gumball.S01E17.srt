1
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:31,129
Behold, Darwin... the grossest thing ever!
I shall name it the gross jar!

2
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,199
It will be my legacy to the world!
It's the coolest thing ever.

3
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,902
But i thought my tap-dancing
dolphin impression

4
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:44,142
was the coolest thing ever.
Yeah, but this just

5
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,511
literally blew you out of the water.

6
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:59,517
What's inside? Well...
- Choo! - Choo! - Choo!

7
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:17,574
O-Kay. So, what are you gonna do

8
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,609
with it? Yeah, well, that's the problem.

9
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:23,547
I don't really know. It needs a final
touch to make it a true masterpiece.

10
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,082
Nuke it!

11
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:30,120
Could you tell me when my coffee's ready?
I'll be in the garden.

12
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:44,401
What's going on? It's looking at me!
Dude, where did you

13
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:47,704
find its eyeball? I-i didn't.
It must be the atomic power of

14
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:53,910
the microwave. It looks like it's alive.

15
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:02,285
Mama. Did you hear that?
It called you "mom."

16
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,121
Then i guess that makes you its dad.

17
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,657
Its dad? Aah! What are we gonna do?!

18
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,293
I don't want to be a baby father!
Let's ditch it!

19
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:13,363
Shh!
don't say stuff like that in front of him!

20
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:16,233
I mean, come on.
He's kind of cute. Hello, little guy.

21
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,970
Don't you worry about a thing.

22
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:26,543
Me and your father will take
care of everything. Darwin!

23
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,079
Where do you think you're going?!

24
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:33,116
Buy some stuff? At the shop?
What are you doing?!

25
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:39,489
He's your son.

26
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:45,395
I'm sorry, little guy.
From now on, I'll always be

27
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:48,031
there for you.

28
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,534
Darwin, i think he's ready
for his first steps. Wait!

29
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:59,375
Go ahead. Come on. don't be shy.
Come to daddy. Aww!

30
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,877
He's kind of got my eyes.
Don't you think?

31
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,080
Aah! He's got my top lip, too!
Dude, it's what

32
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,750
babies do. He's just suckling.
It's not suckling!

33
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,286
It's eating! Okay, relax.
He's just playing.

34
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:16,558
He'll come off on his own.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Aah!

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,029
His teeth are sinking in!
Okay, that's enough! Bad baby!

36
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:23,832
Stop mauling your father and
get back in your jar this insta...

37
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:27,369
Aah! Aah! He's got my neck!
I know what it is.

38
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:32,541
He must be hungry.

39
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:37,279
Okay, so it doesn't like fruits, vegetables,
or cereal. But it<i> does</i> like pigeons, rats,

40
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:40,549
raccoons, seagulls,
and the mailman's butt. What was all that

41
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,752
noise? What are you two up...
aah! What is that thing?!

42
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:46,388
It's our baby.
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,991
Where did you find it?
It came out of the microwave.

44
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:51,894
Are you sure it didn't come
out of the toilet? It's disgusting.

45
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,296
They always look a bit
funny when they're just born.

46
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:57,333
He's actually very advanced for his age.
You should have seen

47
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:00,102
him catch that seagull. What?!
You let that monster out?

48
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:04,173
Look, i was trying to be nice here, but
you better stop insulting our child or i

49
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:07,309
don't know what I'll do.
It's not a child!

50
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,578
And what is it doing in my high chair?

51
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,949
Don't listen to her, Kenneth.
She's just jealous. You called it

52
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:16,819
"Kenneth"? Baby needs a name.
Look, like it or not, you're

53
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,188
Kenneth's aunt.
Now, we're gonna buy more pigeon traps.

54
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,924
You babysit. Are you crazy?
Where do you think you're...

55
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:33,035
I guess you're kind of ugly cute.
What kind of animal<i> are</i> you?

56
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:40,175
Wow. Those are pretty pointy teeth.
What the... aah!

57
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:43,311
Kenneth, we're home! What a mess.

58
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:46,547
Where's anais? Yech. I knew she'd bail.

59
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:49,817
Gumball, has Kenneth grown? Grown into a

60
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,587
troublemaker. This place is a mess!
Naughty Kenneth.

61
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:57,125
Parcel for the wattersons.

62
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:03,531
Hi. Waah! Whoa!
Did Kenneth just eat the mailman?

63
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,967
No, no, no. That's not possible.
Not my Kenneth.

64
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,369
Well, where is he, then?
What do i know...

65
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,005
mailing? I'm more worried about Kenneth.
Does it look to you like he's

66
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:15,410
gaining weight?
I'm more worried about his attitude.

67
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:21,616
This boy needs discipline.
I think we need parental advice.

68
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,719
So, um, we're doing this school project.-

69
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:28,456
And, we've got to look after this,
gross dog thing.

70
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:32,260
I'm with you.
And we need your help disciplining it.

71
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:35,897
Okay. It's pretty simple...
kind of like children, actually.

72
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,635
The first thing you have to do is let it know
you're the pack leader, so you look them in the

73
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:44,338
eyes and tell them
firmly you're the boss.

74
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,645
Now, you've been a naughty doggy!
Dad, he's got your

75
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,381
finger. Well, that's to be expected, son.

76
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:56,884
The best thing to do is to remain
calm and reassert your authority.

77
00:05:56,886 --> 00:06:00,588
Yeah, but it seems to be eating your arm.

78
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,091
It's just testing its boundaries.
The worst you can do is give it

79
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:08,663
attention for negative behavior. I have always
found that a positive-reinforcement approach

80
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,833
is the best way to... Dad!
Kenneth's eaten dad!

81
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:14,802
Probably anais, too!
We've got to save them!

82
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:25,313
We'll save them later!

83
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,849
Hey, kids. Sorry I'm late.
I... What the...

84
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:31,219
Mom, something terrible in the garden
became in the microwave and became alive

85
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:34,588
and swallowed the mailman and dad and anais
and wanted to eat us, and we got here, and...

86
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,123
What? What gumball is

87
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,494
trying to say is the microwave monster
everyone! It's horrible and it's in the

88
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,696
garden and it's really dangerous!
We need to build an army and...

89
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:50,570
Okay, okay. Slow down, boys.
Where's your father?

90
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:53,240
It turned into a monster,
and now it's coming to get us!

91
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:56,309
For goodness' sake. It's probably
just a raccoon. I'll go and check.

92
00:06:56,311 --> 00:07:04,311
You stay here. No! don't go outside!

93
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,257
Richard? Where are you? What's wrong with
the kids? They haven't been this scared

94
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,694
since you made them wax your back.
Richard, you better not be

95
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:21,768
trying to scare me.

96
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:29,643
Aww. Richard?
Richard, stop playing games.

97
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:40,554
Richard? Aaaaaaah!
Mo-o-o-o-o-m! This is all our fault!

98
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,990
It's because we're bad parents! Kenneth
has grown up to be a troubled child.

99
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:46,860
A troubled child that eats people!
We've got to do something!

100
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:54,100
You're right. No video games for a week.
Grounded for two weeks?

101
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,037
Okay. Let's send him to boarding school.

102
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,608
Stop being so soft!
We have to stop him<i> now!</i>

103
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:17,824
What was that? It's an owl.
What was that? A twig.

104
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:20,860
What was that?
That's my butt cheek quivering with fear.

105
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:24,531
Really? Yeah. Look.

106
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,446
Aah! Darwin, this is our chance! Yaah!

107
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:49,288
Are you all right in

108
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:55,227
there? Partly digested and
a little cramped but otherwise

109
00:08:55,229 --> 00:09:00,599
fine. Just get us out of here, please!

110
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:06,338
Dude, we got to do something.

111
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,342
I got it! Tie the hosepipe around
me so that all i have to do is dive

112
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:13,078
into his mouth, grab everyone,
make a human chain...

113
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,383
And when i say, "okay,"
you simply pull us out. Got it? Let's go!

114
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:31,764
Yeah! Did it! Everybody, hold tight.
Okay, gumball, now pull!

115
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:37,036
Gotcha! Okay, this isn't working.

116
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:40,539
Well, think of something else!
Our lives depend on you!

117
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:47,579
I hate to tell you this,
but i got nothin'.

118
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,783
No, no, no!
Kenneth, please don't eat me! Please!

119
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,520
If you like eating people,
i-I'll bring you some, like a good mother.

120
00:09:54,522 --> 00:10:02,522
And, maybe a salad once in a while because
you're starting to get a little bit chubby.

121
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,431
Here's your package.

122
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:12,004
Have a nice day. Gumball!
Great idea, turning

123
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:14,873
on the hose. Pfft. It was nothing.

124
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,910
Just quick thinking, you know?
I-i work best when I'm under pressure.

125
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:22,413
It definitely wasn't an
accident or anything.

126
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,783
Aww, Kenneth. Look at you now.
You're as sweet as when you were

127
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,152
born.
Who could imagine he'd turn into such a...

128
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:31,022
Aah! Dad, no! Are you kidding me?!

129
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:36,627
That thing ate me<i> and</i> barfed me! I'm gonna
end this right now! B-but he didn't mean

130
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,763
it.
It's just that we've been bad parents!

131
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:44,068
Gumball, that thing is a man-eating
monster! Yes, maybe he eats

132
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,339
people once in a while, but maybe, just
maybe, he needs some love and understanding.

133
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:52,276
We are responsible for the future
generations. We make the children that will

134
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,514
become the world of tomorrow. don't blame
Kenneth. Blame yourselves, because you're

135
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,550
my parents, too. What?! Look at him.

136
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:03,621
He won't hurt anyone now. Doesn't
this poor creature deserve a second

137
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:09,560
chance? Aww! Okay. Trust me, guys...

138
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:13,331
this time, it'll be different.

139
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:17,668
On second thought,
we probably should have listened to

140
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,670
dad.

141
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,249
When's someone gonna invent a TV

142
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:37,588
that flicks its own channels?
Hey, honey. How was work?

143
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,459
Is dinner ready yet?
Hey, mom, dad, guess what!

144
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:46,364
I got a b-plus in home ec today!
Miss simian said my soufflé was divine.

145
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,833
Yeah. Yeah, that's very interesting.

146
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:51,936
I also learned how to do a cartwheel.
You guys want to see?

147
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,572
Yeah, yeah. I'm very proud of you, son.

148
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:04,282
I also crashed your car on the run
from the police after i robbed a bank.

149
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:12,283
Good for you. Aah! My leg! It's broken!

150
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:16,459
I probably need to get it cut off!
Aah-haah!

151
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:20,063
And yet nobody cares.
What do i have to do to get

152
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:24,901
noticed in this house?! Ooh! What?

153
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,604
Richard,
i think gumball needs some attention.

154
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:30,640
Maybe you should go and play catch.
Yeah, yeah, we're all

155
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,810
very proud of you, Nicole.

156
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,258
What?

157
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,262
Listen, honey, I'm sorry you've not
been getting enough attention lately.

158
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:55,866
I'm going to make it up
to you starting tomorrow.

159
00:12:55,868 --> 00:13:04,674
Why not now?!
So, penny, want to hang out after school?

160
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:09,145
I'll show you my cartwheel. I've seen it.
It's not as good as it sounds.

161
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,148
Sorry, gumball.
It's cheerleader tryouts tonight.

162
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,518
I've been practicing all year for this.
Another time, though.

163
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,655
Okay. No problem. I love you, penny.

164
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:22,158
What? What? Nothing.
I just said i love peanuts.

165
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,796
Yeah, peanuts. They taste so good.
Gumball, i<i> am</i> a peanut.

166
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:30,300
That's like me saying i like to eat cats.
Maybe you should think twice

167
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,370
about the things you say.
But i<i> did</i> think twice.

168
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:36,773
Well, maybe you need to think <i>three</i> times.
Anyway, see you later.

169
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,409
Wait! I didn't say, "peanuts"!

170
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,012
I said, "ponies"! I love ponies!
They taste of nuts!

171
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:45,348
Whatever. Maybe you need
to talk with your mouth shut.

172
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,318
Is that really the way you talk to girls?

173
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,488
Mom?! What are you doing here?!
Well, you said you

174
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,059
wanted more attention, so i followed you
to school. But by the looks of it, you need

175
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:00,263
more than attention.
You need serious help, little man.

176
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:04,267
Aw, mom, if you're seriously going to
follow us around all day, do you really

177
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,303
need to hold my hand?
Yes. Yay! Mom's at school!

178
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,339
And it's not all day. It's all week.
I took the night shift.

179
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:18,280
Hey, mom, need a diaper for that baby?

180
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:21,984
Ooh, actually, i am fully potty trained,
so check your facts, all right?

181
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,853
You know you got them good

182
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,724
when their voices go high.
Gumball, are you really gonna take that?

183
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:32,394
She just owned you. What?
You got a better idea?

184
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:36,298
Well, first of all, drop an octave.
Then give her a taste of her own

185
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,835
medicine. Try this.

186
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:44,306
Tina, I'd just like to say that maybe
you only bully people because you're

187
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:48,110
insecure about your walnut-sized brain and
the fact that you smell like a sweaty butcher.

188
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:51,313
I'll have you know that
smell is a glandular problem!

189
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:54,750
"Glandular." Wow.

190
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:58,354
It actually worked. Yeah, that was funny.
But good luck when Tina comes

191
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,324
back and your mom's not around to
hold your hand. don't worry, gummy-puss.

192
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:05,995
I'll hold your hand until college
if i have to. "Gummy-puss."

193
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:11,767
Mom, stop embarrassing me! >> it burns!

194
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:15,738
My eyes! What was that?!
I don't know... paint?

195
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,309
Aah! My hair! What was that?
Chlorine from

196
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:24,380
the pool? Unh! Aah!
What was that? Fertilizer?

197
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,583
I guess it's all right, then.

198
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:32,154
But that's still two hours of detention
for potentially damaging my beautiful face.

199
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:36,358
Really, principal brown,
you need to be firmer than that.

200
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,762
- >> - O-okay.
<i>- Four</i> hours' detention.

201
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,364
Eight hours? Good.

202
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:46,869
See you in detention, watterson.
Mom, you're not helping.

203
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:57,678
The nerds think you look like a
dodeca-dork with your mom at

204
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,350
school. What does that mean?
It's a 12-sided dork, honey.

205
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,453
Mom, you're not helping.

206
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,265
Mom, you're not helping!
Whoo-whoo! Come on, honey.

207
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,035
Open the tunnel for the choo-choo train.
Mom, you're not

208
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:24,372
help... Enough!

209
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:28,076
The Tina thing was kind of helpful,
but this has gone too far!

210
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,912
Wait a minute. I... Thanks.

211
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:35,216
Now, seriously, i need you to stop
meddling with my life! I'm not meddling.

212
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm helping. Helping by meddling.
You're just a big meddler!

213
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:42,690
I'm<i> not</i> a meddler.
I'm your mother! And a meddler.

214
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,359
Hey! Isn't that the girl you like?

215
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:48,663
Mom, no! Excuse me, penny.
Have you got a second?

216
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,865
Sure. You guys will need to be quick.

217
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:54,302
The cheerleader tryouts are
about to start. Mom, if you love me,

218
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,371
please don't do this.
Come on, gummy-puss. don't be shy.

219
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,807
My baby has something to say to you.

220
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:02,210
No, i don't.
He'd like to take you out on a date.

221
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:06,013
That's not true. He loves you. >> Really?

222
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:10,518
No, i don't!
I don't love penny, and i never will!

223
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,821
Gumball!
Well, thanks for being honest with me.

224
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:17,525
No, wait! I meant I'll never love peanuts!
No... ponies!

225
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,628
See what you did?! You upset penny!

226
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,431
How am i supposed to get her back?!
Well, you know, i could

227
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,234
help you with that. That's enough!
Okay? That's enough!

228
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:30,571
I'm my own man now! I make my own
decisions, and i don't need you babying me

229
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,774
anymo... anymo...

230
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:37,178
Thanks. Now, just go home, okay? Come on.

231
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,649
We all had a great time.
Didn't we, Darwin? To be honest, I've

232
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:45,219
never been so embarrassed in
my entire life! Why are you smiling,

233
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:48,356
then? Well, at first,
i was trying not to hurt your

234
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,625
feelings, but now I'm just stuck! I

235
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:54,594
beg of you, just get out of my life.
Okay.

236
00:17:54,596 --> 00:18:00,800
I guess I'll just go home, then.

237
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:04,337
Mom, you've got to come back!
I made my own decision!

238
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:10,710
It was a bad one...
a really, really bad one! Thank goodness

239
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:13,246
she's gone.
I'll never smile again. Darwin!

240
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:16,349
Mom, you're back! Yay!
Do you know where your

241
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:22,455
brother is? In the changing room. Thanks.

242
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:26,493
Gumball, it's me.
Open the door. No! No, i won't!

243
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:30,397
What happened? It's awful.
I made a decision on my own, and

244
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:33,833
it was bad. Listen, whatever it
is you've done, you need to come

245
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:39,706
out and face it. All right.
All right. I'm coming out.

246
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,676
You were gonna try and get
closer to penny by joining her

247
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,812
cheer team, but now you feel embarrassed
because you have to wear a skirt.

248
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:49,216
What?! No! I'm gonna beat penny
at her own game so she'll realize how

249
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:52,652
awesome and manly i am.
Then she'll definitely want to date me.

250
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:56,122
Right. So, what's the problem?
The problem is me!

251
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:59,593
What if I'm not as good as the
other girls?! What if they laugh at me?!

252
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:03,730
And this leotard makes me look fat,
so i put this skirt on to hide my butt.

253
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:08,068
What exactly do you want me to do, honey?
Hello?

254
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,838
Be there, of course?
I need emotional support. You're my mom.

255
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,276
Start acting like it. Okay, let's go.

256
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:19,279
♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ hey! ♪ ♪ here we go ♪

257
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,349
♪ hey! ♪ ♪ hey! ♪ ♪ here we go ♪

258
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,385

259
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:28,855
♪ hey! ♪ ♪ hey! ♪

260
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:35,962
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Now, penny,
i have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

261
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:39,099
I know. It's just i had some
emotional problems this afternoon...

262
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:42,202
you leave your emotions at the door!
This is cheerleading, not drama

263
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:45,237
club! You better shape up or ship out,
'cause this is the big leagues,

264
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:49,808
sister, and right now you're at the bottom of
the barrel! Is there anything you'd like to

265
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,112
add, principal brown? Only that
we're making cuts today, and after that

266
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:58,050
performance, someone's going to have
to be pretty bad for it not to be you.

267
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:00,019
Am i too late?

268
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:48,460
- No!
- Mom...

269
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:25,437
Well, it's a no for me, Mr. small.
It's a no for me, too.

270
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:30,409
That's two nos, gumball.
You're going home. No!

271
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:35,046
Mom, make them recount the score!
Make them recount the score!

272
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:40,852
Well, zero plus zero equals zero, honey.
Why is the world so

273
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:44,255
cruel?! Don't worry.
You'll do better next time...

274
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:47,759
After a couple of years' intense training.
gumball, thank you!

275
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:52,163
It was so brave of you to sacrifice
your dignity so i can get on the team.

276
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:55,967
I guess that means you<i> do</i> like me.
Just a little?

277
00:21:55,969 --> 00:22:00,705
Peanuts. Ponies.

278
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:05,343
I think that means "yes."
Mom, you know when i

279
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:09,046
said i wanted to be my own man
and make my own decisions? Yes.

280
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:13,084
Can it just wait for a few years?
The longer, the better,

281
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:16,988
honey. Even when you're 80,
you'll still be my gummy-puss.
