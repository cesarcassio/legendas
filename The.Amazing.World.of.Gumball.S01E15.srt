1
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,063
I think lunch is the best,
because you've already had breakfast...

2
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:36,401
But you still have
dinner to look forward to.

3
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:41,840
A plastic magic wand!
Sweeeet! Make a wish!

4
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:45,210
I wish i had six eyes.

5
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,715
One... Two...

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:57,122
Maybe you have to wave it.
I wish gumball had six eyes. One...

7
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,090
Two...

8
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:05,663
Aw, this magic wand is weak. Magic wand?

9
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,668
Can i have a turn?
Sure, but it doesn't really...

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,473
Cool! With this,
i can make all my wishes come true.

11
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:20,712
My first wish is that this wand doesn't
turn out to be a big fraud, like that stupid

12
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,482
wishbone! What wishbone?
Well, when i was a boy

13
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,651
about your age...

14
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:33,993
I wish that the sausages
would fly into my mouth!

15
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:44,904
Mom, i made a wish on the wishbone, and
nothing happened! What did you think, that it

16
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:48,541
was gonna come true? Magic isn't real.

17
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:56,543
You mean, it's... A fraud? Yeah.
It's a fraud. AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-

18
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:06,225
AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-
AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA... AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-

19
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:12,865
and i didn't stop screaming for 15 years.
AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA...

20
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:17,136
AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA... AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA!

21
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:23,242
AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA!
I never believed in anything again.

22
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:27,947
But i believe this will be different.
Now, I've got some wishing to

23
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,883
do! You know what this

24
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:34,454
means, Darwin. We have to make
sure all of dad's wishes come true.

25
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:38,358
Why? Because if we don't,
he'll never be able to believe

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,795
in anything again.
And he might go crazy and start screaming.

27
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:47,100
We have to make sure he
thinks that wand is real. Yeah!

28
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:53,006
I wish for sausages to fly into

29
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,975
my mouth.

30
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:04,718
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,989
Ptuh!
I think you and me are gonna be friends.

32
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:17,697
Ha-ha! I wish the sink was fixed.
Well, how do you fix

33
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,236
the sink? I don't know. Aaaaaaahh!

34
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:26,072
Quick! Mr. dad's gonna
find out the wand's not real!

35
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:31,278
Aaah.

36
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:45,052
Ptuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Ptuh!
Ptuh! Buh-b-b-b-b-b-b-b!

37
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:52,867
Bah-b-b-b-b! Pweh!
You are truly powerful.

38
00:03:52,869 --> 00:04:00,869
I shall name you... Wanda...
the wonderful wand of wonder!

39
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:06,781
Quick... i think dad's gonna make
another wish. I wish it was raining

40
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:11,585
pancakes!

41
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:15,756
Ooooh.

42
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:27,601
I wish it was Christmas every

43
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,304
day.

44
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:33,307
Ho-ho-ho!

45
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:37,846
Merry Christmas, everyone!

46
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:42,217
Oooh! I wish...

47
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,252
I wish i was taller.

48
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:51,326
Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Now I'm a giant!

49
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:57,299
I wish... I wish i had a monster truck.

50
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,768
Yeah, a monster-truck t-shirt.

51
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:06,041
Heh-heh! Heh!

52
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:09,778
I wish... I wish i could be invisible.
Come on, Darwin.

53
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,618
Just do what i do. Where's dad?
I wonder where he's gone.

54
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,523
Look...
he left his wand floating in midair.

55
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:26,228
He's here. Come on, Darwin.
Let's go and find him.

56
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,999
But he's here. Darwin! I wish...

57
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:37,672
I wish i wasn't so hot. Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Aah! Whoo! Aah!

58
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:42,245
Not again.

59
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,848
Mr. watterson!
Would you kindly refrain from

60
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,819
offending my wife's eyeballs with
your public display of vulgarity?

61
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:54,157
Sorry, Mr. Robinson. Hey.

62
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:59,729
Wait a second.
You picked the wrong day to mess with...

63
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:05,635
The bunny warlock!! Sorry...
what? If it's a fight you

64
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:13,637
want, it's a fight you've got! But i think i
should warn you... i have supernatural powers!

65
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:18,714
The only thing supernatural
about you is your ignorance.

66
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:26,716
I wouldn't be laughing if i was facing...
The mighty bunny warlock!!

67
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:31,727
The only thing mighty
about you is your ignorance.

68
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:37,500
I used the same joke again. Perhaps
you haven't noticed my magic wand and...

69
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:41,638
My cape! >> You don't have a cape.

70
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,578
I wish for a cape. You look ridiculous.
You leave me no choice,

71
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,013
sir. I wish... I wish...

72
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:55,252
Here we go. I wish<i> you</i> looked ridiculous!

73
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:58,655
Aah! Horrible! Take it off! Take it off!

74
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:01,325
Cover your eyes, woman!
Aah! No! Put it back on!

75
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:05,662
Put it back on!
And i wish your wife's head was a melon.

76
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:11,268
Now i wish you would
fly away out of my sight.

77
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,804
Aaah!

78
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:21,078
You dared to doubt the all-powerful
bunny warlock! I can't hold it any

79
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,214
longer! Now, begone!

80
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:28,452
He really is a wizard.

81
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:31,855
Run, Margaret, run! Aah! He! He-he!

82
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,591
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Mr. dad's turning evil.

83
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:38,161
Maybe it's time we told him the truth.
But if we tell him

84
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:42,499
the truth, he's gonna get upset,
like when he was a boy. You're right.

85
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:46,905
I know!
We're gonna have to take the wand back!

86
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:52,043
Is there nothing you can't do, Wanda?

87
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:57,682
I think i finally understand
your true power! I wish...

88
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:00,885
I wish... I w... This has gone on

89
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:05,089
long enough. Hmph!
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

90
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,593
This wand... it has made you evil.
We're taking it back.

91
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:12,397
Hmph! You think that you
mere mortals have the power to

92
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,636
challenge me? Come...
take the wand if you dare.

93
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:25,643
Slip-over spell! We've got to do it.
It'll break his heart if he

94
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:30,915
finds out. Aaaah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Can't you see what

95
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,585
you've become?
I can see perfectly clearly.

96
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:37,889
I have become a master wizard!

97
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:47,266
- Slow-motion spell!
- It's power has overtaken you.

98
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:50,402
Reverse spell!
You overtaken has power it's!

99
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:55,240
No, it's more like ouy
nekatrevo sah rewop s'ti!

100
00:08:55,242 --> 00:09:01,146
Love spell!

101
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:13,759
Inside-out spell!

102
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,496
Gross! Back-to-normal spell!

103
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:21,367
H-ha-ha-ha-ha! Give us the wand!

104
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:25,337
Never! I wish your face was his
butt and his butt was your face!

105
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,475
Really? I wished it, didn't i?

106
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:35,247
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Now i wish that your butt was

107
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,517
his face and his face was your butt!

108
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,623
Naaaaaaa-ha-ha! I wish that, um, your
face was kissing his butt and his butt

109
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,694
- was kissing your face!
- A-ha-ha!

110
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:51,231
This has got to stop. AAA-ha-ha-ha-ha!

111
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:55,435
Dad! We've got something to tell you.
What's going on?

112
00:09:55,437 --> 00:10:00,774
Why have you stopped? That wand's a fake.
It's just a plastic toy, free

113
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:05,645
from a cereal packet.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! What nonsense!

114
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,849
If that's true, how do you explain<i> this?</i>
Yaaaaa...

115
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:18,058
It was us. We've been making
it happen right from the start.

116
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,997
I hope you're not mad at us. You mean
you two kids spent the whole day making

117
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:28,968
incredible wishes come true?
You did that all for me? Of course!

118
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,108
Even when i made your butt kiss his face and
his face kiss your butt, you did that for

119
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,977
- me?
- Come here and give me a

120
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:43,983
big hug. Mmmmmm. But hang on.

121
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:50,758
If<i> you</i> were making my wishes come true,
doesn't that mean that Wanda the wonderful wand

122
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,829
of wonder is a fraud? Yeah.

123
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:59,834
A fraud?

124
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:04,705
Yaa-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAA...

125
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:13,280
It's mine! The power is all mine!

126
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:16,650
I wish you didn't have
that ridiculous haircut.

127
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:20,488
I wish i hadn't said that.

128
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:01,363
Aaah!

129
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:06,835
Careful, numbskull! These trophies are
a symbol of my excellence as a teacher.

130
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:11,807
It took me 754 years to collect them all.

131
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,410
What was that?! Hello!
"Favorite teacher award"?

132
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:19,347
It's like the best one and stuff,
but you'll never win it. Why not?

133
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:25,520
Because you need a letter of recommendation
from a student who... Actually likes you.

134
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:30,292
That sounds easy enough.
Seriously, though, no one likes

135
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:38,294
you, miss simian... not even me!
And i like<i> everybody.</i> Nobody likes me?

136
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,874
Dude, i think something's
wrong with miss simian.

137
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:48,577
What makes you say that? She hasn't told

138
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:51,113
anyone off all day.
[ Music blaring, laughter,

139
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:54,784
[ indistinct shouting ] That<i> is</i> weird.

140
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:57,720
Whoo-hoo! Hey, guys! Wait up!

141
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:03,259
Gumball? Yeah...?
You and i are friends, right?

142
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:07,263
Are we? Well, what with all
the detentions and everything, i

143
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:12,568
guess we spend a lot of time together...
I guess so.

144
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,139
Anyway, gotta go. Just one more thing.
Would you mind if i hang out

145
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,811
with you just for a little while?...Yeah.

146
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:26,349
Yeah, i would.
Basically, she asked to be my friend.

147
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:31,754
Well, i told her "no," obviously.
But now she's just following me

148
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:35,691
around. And the strangest thing is,
she's completely unresponsive.

149
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:38,461
Watch. See? Nothing!

150
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:44,800
Try something hot. Is she still there?

151
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,769
Yep.

152
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:56,346
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!! Fetch!

153
00:13:56,348 --> 00:14:00,050
I hope things get better tomorrow.

154
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:06,023
What is she doing in my house?

155
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:10,861
I'm sorry. I just thought that maybe
we could share a nice breakfast

156
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:16,533
together, but since you all hate me,
I'll just go. I'm walking.

157
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:21,505
It's so sad. This is me...
On my way. I'm at the door.

158
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:26,877
This is kind of harsh. I'm turning
the doorknob. I'm opening the door.

159
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,249
I don't know why, but I'm crying!
Boy, it sure looks lonely out

160
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:36,987
there.
Mom, why do you hate miss simian so much?

161
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:40,057
I don't want to talk about it.

162
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:45,128
Please let her stay! Okay.
She can stay, but...

163
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,699
thank you!
You're such a kind and friendly family!

164
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:54,271
You know, I've never had friends before.
I don't even know what friends

165
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:58,509
do. Don't worry. We'll show you.

166
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:04,649
Now, a very important part of friendship
is sharing. Imagine you both have ice

167
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:08,052
creams. But what's this?

168
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:13,858
Darwin has dropped his ice cream.
I said, "Darwin has dropped his

169
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,662
ice cream." Splat!

170
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:21,499
You got it on my shoes.
Do you want to share

171
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,168
mine? Very good.

172
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,409
Ice cream, Darwin? Aw, thanks!
But, gumball,<i> you</i> don't have

173
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:35,880
an ice cream. Want to share mine? Sure.

174
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:48,926
Dude, this is so gross! Why don't you
pretend you have your own ice cream?

175
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:53,965
Why didn't<i> i</i> think of that?
Friends also high-five, like

176
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,069
this. High-five! Okay, now...

177
00:15:57,071 --> 00:16:00,039
No, i meant slap my...

178
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:04,576
Let's move on to the next lesson.
How about we all play a game,

179
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:08,313
like friends do?
Here's one we made up. It's called...

180
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:12,851
Dodge or dare!
Roll the dice. Take a card.

181
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:17,756
What'd you get? "Put a gooey
hair ball in miss simian's lunch."

182
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,592
L-let me take that. Pick another.

183
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,395
"When miss simian's back is turned..."

184
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:26,365
A-actually, let me pick one for you.
"cover simian in slug juice,

185
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,401
drop water balloons on simian,
miss simian, miss simian, miss simian..."

186
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:32,471
heh heh. Forget the cards. Here's a dare.
Make the most annoying noise

187
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:38,844
possible. >> Eeeh... O... Kay.

188
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:43,282
That was... Good, but we know that
you can do better. Like when you're mad

189
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,317
at us. >> you mean this little thing?

190
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:52,324
Gu-u-u-u-mba-a-a-a-ll!! That... Was...

191
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:55,828
- Awesome!
- High-five!

192
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:02,402
That still needs a little work.
I've got my eye on you, simian.

193
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:07,407
Do it again! Do it again!

194
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:17,951
I'm so pleased to finally
have such great friends!

195
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:22,689
We love you, miss simian. Sorry, kids.
Miss simian, c-can i have a word

196
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:28,061
with you in private, please?
Yes, Nicole, how can i help you?

197
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,332
Listen, simian, you might have the
rest of them fooled, but i don't trust you

198
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,969
for a second. I remember you from school.
I remember the horrible name you

199
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:40,440
used to call me every day.
Do you remember that? Yes, i do.

200
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:44,511
And I'm sorry. What?
I was that horrid person for

201
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:49,983
so long, and look where it got me.
No friends, no family... just

202
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:57,023
bitterness and wrinkles. But even an old ape
can change. Will you give me that chance?

203
00:17:57,025 --> 00:18:01,795
I don't know. It's all happening so fast.
Ple-e-e-e-e-ase?

204
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:06,867
Okay, I'll... I'll give it another shot.

205
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:11,438
What do we do now, best friends?
Let's see.

206
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,142
I know! Best friends write letters
to each other about how great they

207
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,978
are. Wow! What a... Friendly idea.

208
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,183
What shall we write? Um...
Ooh... How about "we, the

209
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,220
aforementioned, unanimously agree that miss
simian is worthy of this year's 'favorite

210
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,956
teacher' award."
"Favorite teacher award."

211
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,327
Okay! Done it! It's mine!

212
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:38,465
- A! Ha-a!
- A!

213
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:42,203
Look how happy she is.
That's the power of

214
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:46,373
friendship. Wow! You baked that cake for

215
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,710
miss simian? Yeah.
I think she deserves a second

216
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,214
chance. Is miss simian around? Nah, dude.

217
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,817
She just drove off.
You should have seen her, all

218
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:02,157
dancing and laughing, saying she finally got
some losers to write her a "favorite teacher"

219
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,928
nomination.

220
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:14,002
What was the word she used? >> "Losers."

221
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:20,542
Unh! Heh! Nice first steps, loser! Unh!

222
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:25,614
Nice cycling, loser! Nice "poem," loser!

223
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:32,254
Nice hair, loser. Nice husband, loser!

224
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:36,291
Everyone, get back in the car.

225
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:41,563
Now? Soon, the trophy will be mine.

226
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,231
Aaaah! We'll see about that,

227
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,735
you two-faced baboon! There's
nothing you can do about it, loser!

228
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:50,305
Mom! What are you doing?!
Something i should have

229
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:53,541
done a long time ago.

230
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Kids, throw stuff at her! But isn't that

231
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,150
dangerous? Not as dangerous
as disobeying your mother!

232
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:10,059
Sorry! >> Aaah! Open your mouth.

233
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:13,829
Aah! I hope you like

234
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:19,101
pepperoni! >> Aaaaaah! Aaaah!

235
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:29,145
That was close. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

236
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:35,284
Cool! Not coo-o-o-o-l! I thought you were

237
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:38,988
our friend, miss simian. Ha!
Who needs friends when you have

238
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,357
this letter? Aah!

239
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,926
There it is, Richard! Get it!

240
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:47,697
Do what?! I'll get closer,
and you lean in and grab it.

241
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:54,970
Seriously? Little bit closer, honey!

242
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:59,041
Ooh! Almost... There! Aah! Dad!

243
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:03,079
Oooh-whoo! Whoo-oooh! Hold on! Waaah-ha!

244
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:05,582
Hi. >> Bye!

245
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:12,689
Aaaaaaaah!

246
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:17,060
Got it! Ha ha! Aaaaaah!

247
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:27,671
Whoooooa! Never... Trick...
My... Family... Again!

248
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:32,409
Mom, watch out!

249
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:37,180
Aaah!

250
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:41,818
And that, kids, is why you wear

251
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,991
seatbelts. Where's miss simian? >>...

252
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:53,463
Hey! Miss simian, no!
You could still be friends with

253
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,432
us if you like.

254
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:07,645
Nah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

255
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:12,917
What did i miss?

256
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,888
Dad! Just simian taking a little tumble.

257
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,225
Maybe that'll teach her
for "monkeying around."

258
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:25,263
We shouldn't laugh. She may be
seriously hurt. Well, you shouldn't have

259
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:29,767
"gibbon" her a second chance. No, really.

260
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:34,305
That's enough. Well, she shouldn't
have "orangu-tangled" with us.

261
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:37,275
I said that's enough.

262
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:46,517
That was so worth it.
