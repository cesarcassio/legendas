Look, Darwin. Shampoo.

333
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Perfect for bald people.

334
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,720
-Ooh.
-What's that?

335
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,640
It's a safe, Darwin. It's full of money.

336
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,880
And what do bald people need more of?

337
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
-Friends?
-Exactly.

338
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,360
-And how do you buy friends?
-Uh...

339
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
With money.

340
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
[both] Yay!

341
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
Huh. There's a lock.

342
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
What number should I try?

-No.
-Nine!

-Nope.
-Well, that's all the numbers I know.

348

-Try two again. [sighs]

Thanks.

Where are the boys?

354
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Well, I forgot your birthday,
so I sent them down to

355
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840
the gas station to get you a present.

356

What?

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,960
Oh.

358
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Is it the birthday or sending two kids
downtown at night on their own?

359
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
Put your pants on and get in the car!

[both] Whoa!

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,160
Can't believe you sent the kids
to the gas station at this hour.

367
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
Come on, honey.
What's the worst that could happen?

368

-Hey.
-Freeze, suckers!

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Why are you tied up?

374
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh.

375
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
He's not really a good guy, is he?

376
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh, come on!

377
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,560
-Now give me the money!
-No!

378
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
Run, Darwin, run!

379

Give me that bag right now!

380

Don't worry. I've covered his approach
with maple syrup.

And I've covered our way out.
