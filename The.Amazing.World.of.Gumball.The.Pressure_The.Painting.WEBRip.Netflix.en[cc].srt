00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,280
[Molly] So, what do you think
of my tree house, girls?

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,640
Very nice!

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,840
I just love what you've done
with the bathroom.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,520
[Molly] Thanks.
I went for understated chic.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,520
Molly has such a good eye
for interior design.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
-Yeah.
-Oh, yes.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Boring! You think because it's in a tree,
it's all that?

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,760
Well, it isn't.
It's just as boring as a real house.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
I mean, what is it
you actually do in here, Molly?

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,960
Well, I just hang out, watch the boys.

Lame!

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,360
You don't watch boys-- you kiss them.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
What?

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,440
Hold on.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Don't tell me you don't have boyfriends.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,920
You do, Molly, right?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Uh, sure, I do.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,040
You don't know him, though.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,760
He's way older, and he's in high school.

-Wow!
-Wow!

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,480
Well, my boyfriend's so old,
that he doesn't have a babysitter.

-Wow!
-Wow!

Well, mine's so old,
he stopped wearing braces.

Don't tell me you want to impress
those-- those-- those perfumed sissies!

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,120
You mean those girls over there? Nah!

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
They wouldn't care about
a handsome bachelor, 12 years old,

35

who likes world cinema,
fine dining, extreme sports,

Do you have a boyfriend?

Yeah. [nervous chuckle]

He's-- I-- it's...

It's...

Darwin!

-Darwin?
-Darwin?

Yeah! He's great because he's got legs,

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,880
and, you know, a head.

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
OK.

No. This way!

Here he is!

Oh, come on.
He's not your boyfriend, Masami.

[scoffs] He so is. Look.

Uh, OK.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,480
I'll show you how much he likes me
at the tree house.

It's always the quiet ones.

She's not my girlfriend!

What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

I know!
I'll just run away and hide forever!

So, what are we talking about?

102
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,000
[scoffs] Well, before you so rudely
interrupted us, we were talking

103
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,440
about how Darwin
is gonna kiss me in the tree house.

-What?
-Yeah.

and girlfriend do!

Hey, Masami.
Have you seen Gumball anywhere?

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,200
Oh, no. I can't do that to Penny.

129
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,520
On one hand,
I create a diversion and save Darwin.

130
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,480
But on the other hand,
I splash Penny and look like a--

131
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
What was that?

132
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,560
I don't know, but it sounded painful.

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Oh, well. See you at the tree house.

134
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880

Hey, dude. Nice bikini.

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,360
Thanks. Oh, Rocky, wait!

144
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,840
You've had girlfriends before, right?

145
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,440
Oh, yeah. Thousands of them.

146
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,760
Well, how do you get rid of them?

147
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Well, usually,
I just close my eyes and open my heart.

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,240
And when I open my eyes again,
they're gone.

149
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
What do you mean?

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,640
Well, I guess they don't want me
to talk about my feelings.

151
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,480
So, you mean,
openly expressing your emotional turmoil

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,640
rather than coming up
with a convoluted little scheme?

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
It's so crazy, it just might work!

Listen, Masami.
This is very difficult for me to say.

157
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm leaving.

158
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,240
We've had good times together,
but it's just not right for me.

159
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't help how I feel.
It's not your fault.

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,200
It's mine. I'm just not ready
for something this amazing.

161
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,400
You deserve someone better.

162

[Gumball] I don't know.

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,240
Nice work, Romeo.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
OK! OK! I didn't mean it!

168
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,360
Boyfriend joke! Look! I'm laughing!
Ha-ha-ha!

169
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
You can stop crying now. Please?

170
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,040
Please, I'll do anything you want!
I'll go to the tree house!

171
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll-- I'll-- I'll kiss you!

172
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
OK. See you there, sweet lips.

173
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

174
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,680
What did you make me do?

175
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
What did you make me do?

176
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
I have to kiss a girl!
I'm going to get married!

177
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,240
I don't want to get married! [groans]

178
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm sorry, dude.
Oh, don't be like that.

179
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,480
Not cool, man! Not cool!

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,360
Don't worry, buddy. I'll save you.

181
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,840
How? You need to have a date
to get in that tree house!

182
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah. That is true.

183
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,960
And what happened to "Pals before gals"?

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,320
Ah, it's cool.
I'll find a plan to save him.

185
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,799
You'd better,
'cause if you don't, we will.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
Hi, Gumball.

187
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,280
[giggling]

188
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,000
After you, boyfriend.

189
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,480
{\an8}Somebody, please help me.

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
-What did you say?
-Nothing!

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,440
I'm climbing. Climbing.

192
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Hey, Darwin.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,280
[gasps] Oh, no! They got you, too!

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Oh, yeah. They got me.

195
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,600
It was horrible. Oh. Oh, no.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
Don't drag me in there and kiss me.

197
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,400
Oh, well, now that we're here...

198
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,960
So, girls,
where are all of your boyfriends?

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
[whistling]

200
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,760
OK, girls. Confession time.

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,920
My boyfriend's not real.

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,040
[all gasp]

203
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
-Yeah, mine, too.
-I made mine up.

204
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,400
So, me and Penny
are the only ones with boys to kiss.

205
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
Darwin?

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Come on, boyfriend!

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,520
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

208
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Gumball! Do something!

209
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
Just a minute. Sorry.

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,080
I have to save my best friend.

211
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm really glad you came.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,040
Oh! Please! You don't want to kiss me!

213
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,920
I taste like fish!

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,040
-[screams]
-Get back here!

215
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,840
-[Darwin] Gumball!
-It's such a beautiful day, Gumball.

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah, but not as beautiful
as your antlers.

217
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,360
Can you feel the universe
moving around us?

218
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,280
{\an8}Uh, yeah. It's sort of like
a swaying motion, actually.

219
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,920
[laughing]

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Let's kiss
and remember this for all eternity.

221
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,760
Let's kiss, so I can show
these losers who's boss.

222
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,520
Mmm...

223
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,280
Mmm...

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,360
[kisses]

225
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,080
-Timber!
-Timber!

226
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Wow!

227
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
That was amazing!

228
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Bye, Penny.

229
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
See you later, sugar lumps.

230
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,120
Ah. What fascinating creatures.

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,080
Pals before gals!

232
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,120
[Nigel] So, Mr. And Mrs. Watterson,
I called you in today

233
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,360
to discuss concerns regarding
your daughter, Anais.

234
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,600
Judging by this alarming painting,
you, madam,

235
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,120
are suffering from work-related stress.

236
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,680
You, sir, are not a good role model.

237
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,720
And these two children
are clearly lacking in discipline.

238
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
[screaming]

239
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Kids, calm down, please!

240
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,200
When I look at this painting,
I see a family that...

241
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,680
A family that has problems.

242
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,000
Principal Brown, if I may interrupt--

243
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,960
[Nigel] Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
It's not your fault.

244
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,920
It's your fault!

245
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm sorry, Princess Cheesecake.
The sausage fairy made me do it.

246
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Sweetie, I had no idea
we were such a terrible family.

247
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
Boys, please!

248
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Anyway, for the good of your family,

249
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,840
I've drawn up a recovery schedule
to get you back on track.

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,560
Woo-hoo!

251
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
I'll make it short.

252
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,600
You, madam,
need to stop working and relax.

253
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Your husband needs to stop relaxing
and work.

254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,240
As for you, Gumball and Darwin...

255
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
-[chuckles]
-[gasps]

256
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,960
You'll be spending the day with Mr. Small,

257
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,280
the school counselor, to channel
your energy in a less destructive way.

258
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
Well, Principal,
we'd be happy to try anything if you

259
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,400
think it's going to help Anais.

260
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,160
Can I just say something?

261
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
You don't need to, sweetie.

262
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,640
We're all going to get better,
right, boys?

263
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
[both] Uh-huh.

264
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,600
-I said, "Right, boys?"
-Yes!

265
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,840
Of course, honey!

266
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,440
-What did I just agree to?
-You got to get a job.

267
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,320
No!

268
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Well, thank you, Principal Brown.
We'll do our best.

269
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
[door opens, closes]

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,440
Uh, Mr. Watter--

271
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,240
Welcome to my five-step program
for undisciplined children.

272
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,960
Step one-- primal scream.

273
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,880
-What's that?
-What's that?

274
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,840
It's when you channel all your rage
into a violent, vocal release, like this.

275
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Aah.

276
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
You guys try it.

277
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,800
-Uh, I don't think I have any rage.
-Me neither.

278
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,920
Everyone has anger, Gumball.

279
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Just look inside yourself and find it.

280
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
Inside?

281
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Do you see anything?

282
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,440
No, nothing at all.

283
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
-Try it anyway.
-OK.

284
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Oh, you can do better than that.

285

[squeaking]

286
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,040
OK, Darwin. Your turn.

287
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,480
Take a deep breath and let it all out!

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,880
[static crackling]

289
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
OK, Nicole. Relax.
It's for the good of my daughter.

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,800
So I'm just going to sit and do nothing.

291
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Oh, this is going to be hard.

292
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,120
So, how about those FK reports
that Simon drew up?

293
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,320
Oh, yeah.
I was reading them in the bathroom.

294
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,040
Huh. Too much information, Charlie!

I think you're the best employee
we ever had at Chanax Incorporated.

297
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
Here's the key to the executive washroom.

298
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
[gasps] No way!

299
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, all I have to do is make that dream
come true and I'll be fine.

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,720
-I'll do it for you, my little girl!
-[stomach grumbling]

301
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,880
I need that key to the executive washroom.

[both laughing]

305

Step two, we need to channel
your destructive energy

306
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
into something creative, like painting.

307
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
-Oh. OK.
-Oh. OK.

308
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,200
When you think about painting,
do you think about something like this?

309
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

310
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, you're wrong! This is not painting!

The world is your canvas.
Now, be the brush!

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000

Your turn, Darwin.

[Nicole breathing heavily]

So, that's the whole house washed,
the car triple waxed,

321
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
I've bleached the fruit,

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
and all its contents.
And have polished my cleaning products,

five hours before anyone gets home.
