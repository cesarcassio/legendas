1
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:31,137
You know what?
I don't think I'm gonna wear this anymore.

2
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,473
Why? I thought it brought you good luck.

3
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,711
Yeah, it does, but
nothing's fun anymore.
See? Watch this.

4
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:44,219
Whoa! Ta-da. Whoop-de-boring-do.

5
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:47,589
What are you talking
about?!
That was fan-flapping-tastic!

6
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:51,826
Yeah, a week ago,
maybe, but now it's just lame.
I think I'm gonna throw it out.

7
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:55,030
Don't throw it out!!
I could really use some luck
right now.

8
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:58,567
I've been trying to get on
"win or don't win" for five
months, but they're not

9
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:02,238
returning my calls.
You're never gonna get
on that show, hat or no hat.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,908
There's a show called "hat or no hat"?

11
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,347
Look, you want it? You have it.

12
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,585
Hello? Would i?! Tomorrow?!

13
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:19,056
Thank you,
"win or don't win"!
Wow! This hat is amazing!

14
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:23,428
Okay, guys, as
impressive as all this is,
let's not get carried away.

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,399
There's no way a tinfoil hat is
responsible for...
Richard! What are you...

16
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,602
Hello?

17
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:35,875
Interview? Tomorrow?
For a promotion and a pay rise?!

18
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:41,080
What was that?
That was the sound of
doom for the wattersons.

19
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:48,422
Do you ever miss your helmet?

20
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:51,860
No. Why?
Well, everyone seems
to be using it for really cool

21
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,198
stuff, like dad with the TV show
or mom with her job.
All you ever did was lame party

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,833
tricks. It doesn't matter, Darwin.

23
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:03,105
I'm happy to see the back of it.
Succeeding at everything really
took the joy out of life.

24
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:06,943
Besides...
Sometimes in life, you make your
own luck!

25
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:12,349
It's so good to fail again.

26
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:17,421
You see, you take a pinch of
success, a dash of failure, you
mix it together, and that's what

27
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:21,726
makes life int...
See? That wasn't so bad.

28
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,630
You just blew up the ant farm.

29
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:29,268
It's okay! Aah!

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,707
Life is great, Darwin! So, you're saying

31
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,878
you're happy when you fail?
Absolutely.
It's the struggle that makes a

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,819
victory sweet.
Besides, i still got it.
Aaaah!

33
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:49,957
Butter side down, just like
poor uncle Eddie.
What do you know...

34
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,195
my lunch is on the floor.
Hey, who's the funny guy who did
that?

35
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,398
And you

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,369
know what the best thing about failure is,
Darwin? No.

37
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,305
Is that it builds your sense of humor.

38
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:10,446
Who am i kidding?

39
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:16,986
I'm nothing without my helmet!
I want it back!
I need it!

40
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:22,526
But i need it<i> more,</i>
'cause i need to win the show!
Well,<i> i</i> need it to get

41
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:26,597
the promotion, which is more
important than a game show.
But if i win the show,

42
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,568
I'll get a speedboat!
Think about how great it would
be for<i> me!</i>

43
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,972
Richard, you'll never
use it.
Nicole, if i win a

44
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:38,544
speedboat, I'm<i> gonna</i> use it.
You have to understand,
I'm doing this for the greater

45
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:41,847
good.
Winning the speedboat will be
good for<i> you</i> but not for the

46
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:48,121
rest of the family... You're right.
I'm sorry, Nicole.

47
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:51,692
I-i don't know what came over
me.
It's okay.

48
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:57,098
Just, where did you hide the
helmet?
It's in this bag.

49
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,034
No, wait!

50
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:05,507
Actually, it's in... it's in
this one.
I was gonna trick you.

51
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:11,113
I'm sorry.
I guess that helmet's got more
power over me than i thought.

52
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:16,753
Thanks for being honest,
honey.
That was an astonishing

53
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:20,290
interview.
There's... Just one thing.
You<i> are</i> aware that

54
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:24,194
if you get the job, you won't be
able to wear that papier-mâché
helmet, right?

55
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:27,698
Of course. But for the record, it's not

56
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,401
papier-mâché. It's tinfoil. >> no.

57
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:35,173
I'm pretty sure it's
papier-mâché painted gray.
What?

58
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:41,980
Can i switch your TV on?
Sure?
<i>And he's won the speedboat!</i>

59
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,852
<i>Yay!</i>

60
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:59,933
This isn't going to affect my
chances, is it?

61
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:04,339
Um, what do<i> you</i> think? It's mine!

62
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:08,343
No, mine!
Give it back! Give it back!
It's mine!

63
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,479
I lost my job for it! It's mine!

64
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:14,250
I need it!
But I'm on "hat or no
hat" tomorrow!

65
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,519
Give... It... Back!

66
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:21,557
Stop it!
Look at what you've become!
This stupid hat is driving you

67
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:24,127
crazy! Actually, it's a helmet.

68
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,731
It's not a helmet or a
hat!
It's a piece of tinfoil!

69
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,901
And it's tearing this family
apart!
Look at you!

70
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:35,406
You're behaving like animals!
Anais is right.

71
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:38,609
That helmet has such a grip on
us.
It's like its magic is

72
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:41,546
taking control of the person who
wears it.
Ha!

73
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,750
Well, since none of you guys
want it, i guess i can have it
back.

74
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:48,454
No!
Me and Darwin have been talking,
and we've decided it has to be

75
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:50,956
destroyed. What?! You can't destroy it!

76
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,093
I'm nothing without it!
I'm sorry, honey, but
anais is right.

77
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,729
Can... can i have one more go? No!

78
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,732
Don't touch it!! Hey! No! No! No!

79
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,102
It's mine! Aah! Aah! No! It's my helmet!

80
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:05,673
Dude, chill out.
It's just a bucket with some
tinfoil on it.

81
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:10,745
Aaah! Give it back!
It's my helmet!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

82
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:18,086
Why can't we just put
it in the bin?
Because they'll just

83
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:22,558
pull it out again.
We have to take it to the bin of
all bins... the dump.

84
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,431
Can't we just rip it
up?
Have you ever tried

85
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,068
ripping up tinfoil?
Sounds horrible.
What are we gonna do

86
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,105
with it, then?
Throw it in the
garbage crusher.

87
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:45,316
Can you hear that? What? That noise.

88
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:48,887
Sounds like a cat trying to say
"snake."
Snake.

89
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,790
It's probably just the wind. Maybe.

90
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:55,494
I don't know what the big deal
with this lucky helmet is,
anyway.

91
00:06:55,496 --> 00:07:01,001
Looks pretty normal to me.
Look... a gold ring!
Look... a pearly necklace!

92
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,505
Wow!
A diamond-encrusted chain!
And it spells "Darwin"!

93
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:09,644
Come on. We're nearly there.

94
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:16,083
I-i can't do it, anais.
It's... it's too heavy.

95
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,954
Well, give me the
helmet.
I'll deal with it.

96
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:23,158
No!
It's a man's job.
You're... you're just a little

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,064
girl. The helmet is<i> my</i> burden to carry.

98
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:33,469
You can carry<i> me,</i> though!

99
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,953
There. I've done my part.

100
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:51,823
Now you do<i> yours.</i>
Throw the stupid thing in the
crusher.

101
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:58,898
Okay!
Well, good riddance!
Darwin, look out!

102
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,134
Give
me my helmet!
The helmet's mine! Give it back!

103
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,870
Give it! Give it!
Dude, what's wrong
with your voice?

104
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,140
I just really need to cough.

105
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,142
Better. Aha! No!

106
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:12,412
Give it up, gumball! There's two of us!

107
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:16,217
You'll never win! Yeah?

108
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:21,289
I can already feel its power!
Well, not for long!
Come on, Darwin.

109
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:30,799
You'll never hit me!
I'm the luckiest man alive!
It's not luck!

110
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,636
It's just we can't throw very
well!
Then let me make it

111
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,808
easy for you.
Come on, anais!
There's no way you can miss from

112
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,247
there!

113
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:48,886
Nice try, but now it's<i> my</i> turn.

114
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:52,089
Look... a tennis-ball machine.

115
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,827
Good luck finding a power supply
for that.
Look... a

116
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:59,264
generator.
Okay, maybe the hat<i> is</i>
magic after all.

117
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:02,267
Run!!

118
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:09,709
He's got us cornered!
What are we gonna do?!
Pass me that stale

119
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,645
baguette. Why? don't you worry about

120
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:14,782
it. Just tell mom and dad i love them.

121
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:19,887
What? Darwin, no!

122
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:30,291
- No!
- No! My power!

123
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,137
Come on, Darwin!
He lost the helmet!
Cool.

124
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:42,412
No! No! No, no! No!! Gumball!!

125
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:51,989
Almost... Got... It. What the...

126
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,694
what is wrong with you?!
My helmet...
I can almost reach it.

127
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:01,633
Give me your hand! No! I need the power!

128
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,837
For goodness' sake,

129
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,440
man!
It's only a piece of tinfoil!
But think of all the

130
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:13,780
stuff we could do with it. Yes! Ha ha!

131
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:18,918
Okay, you can pull me up now.
Listen, gumball, the
helmet is powerful, but it's

132
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,990
also evil.
Look at what it's
done to you and mom and dad!

133
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:27,428
But... but without
it, I'm nothing!
Gumball,<i> we're</i> nothing

134
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,766
without<i> you.</i> So, give me your other hand.

135
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:42,278
Whoo.

136
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:00,932
Yay!

137
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:10,576
Richard, are you sure
this is a good idea?
Of course, honey.

138
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:16,182
I said I'd use it, didn't i?
How far away
is the sea?

139
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,418
About 100 miles.

140
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:31,933
<i>And welcome to the welterweight title.</i>

141
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:35,369
You okay? Yep.

142
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:40,542
School was awesome today!
I was hanging out with Tina.
She taught me how to donate to

143
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:43,111
charity. Who is this for, again? >> Me.

144
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:47,015
Then she helped tear through my homework.

145
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:52,622
And finally, we had
lunch together.
What should i try first?

146
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:57,928
Lasagna. It was great!

147
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,698
What? I think you're being bullied.

148
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,301
Nah. We're just having fun... Nope.

149
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:07,405
You're definitely getting bullied.

150
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:11,109
What am i gonna do?!
Don't worry, bro.
I'll take care of this for you.

151
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:15,780
Hey, Tina, you've been picking
on my brother, and i think it's

152
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,719
time you guys talked about this
face-to-face.

153
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,755
Tomorrow? 4:00 P.M.?

154
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:25,726
Behind the school?! No, wait!

155
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,295
That's not what i meant! Oopsie.

156
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:31,064
Well? Looks like your

157
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:35,904
face-to-face turned into more of
a... Face-to-fist.
What the...

158
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,673
what?!
I think she wants to
have a fight with you.

159
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,176
<i>He's out cold!</i> Come on, son.

160
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:48,450
It's time i showed you how to
deal with bullies.
There comes a point in every

161
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:54,023
man's life where he has to stand
up for himself.
But that's okay, 'cause daddy's

162
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:59,229
here to teach you an old family
technique that got me out of
trouble many times.

163
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,867
Oooh. A secret fighting technique? Yes.

164
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:09,307
It's called...
The bunny hop.
But remember, you must never use

165
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,678
it in anger.
I promise, father.
All right.

166
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,682
You be the bully.
Okay.
Come on. don't be shy.

167
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:21,186
Try to take my lunch money.
Aah! don't hurt me!

168
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,723
Not the face!
Here's my lunch money... and my
lunch!

169
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:28,294
Please, take it!
Please, please, please!
That was step one.

170
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:34,234
And here comes the bunny hop.
Hah.
Blblblblblblblblblblblblbl!

171
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:40,541
Well, that wasn't
much help.
You're right.

172
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:47,182
I think you need help from a
<i>real</i> adult.
So, school counselor.

173
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:52,455
Pretty scary title?
But don't you worry your tiny,
little heads about it.

174
00:13:52,457 --> 00:14:00,196
Think of me as a friend, a
compadre, a fellow pilgrim on a
mad journey we call...

175
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:03,934
Life.
So, tell me, what's shakin'?
I'm fine.

176
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,104
No, he's not! He's being bullied! >>.

177
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:13,111
The big "b," You know,
more often than not, conversation beats

178
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:16,414
confrontation. Hands down.

179
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:24,417
Let's meditate on this.
Ohmmmmmmm.
Ohmmmmmmmmmmm.

180
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:28,694
So, tell me, who's bullying
you?
Tina Rex.

181
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:31,431
Tina Rex?!

182
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:39,105
Don't tell her you saw me!
Well, that wasn't much
help.

183
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:42,610
No way!
Gumball's gonna fight Tina?
She's gonna mash him!

184
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:46,647
He's toast!
She's gonna skin him alive!
This will be the greatest

185
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,052
fight ever! This is getting out of hand.

186
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,587
Don't worry. I'll fix this. Come on!

187
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,292
What is wrong with you guys?
How many of you have been
bullied by Tina?

188
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,695
Maybe. >> I guess. >> I have.

189
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:05,568
Don't you realize if
we all join forces, we can stand
up to Tina once and for all?

190
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,507
And no student will ever be
bullied again!

191
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,410
Yeah! We can also stop global warming!

192
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,213
Yeah! And bring peace to the world!

193
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,018
Yeah!
And build schools for
the dolphins in the rainforests

194
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,155
so they can cure baldness! Yeah! Anais?

195
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,059
Sorry, gumball!
The power's gone to my head!
See you on capitol hill!

196
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:32,031
Good luck with the fight, man!

197
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,500
There you are. Darwin!

198
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,703
You're supposed to be here when
your best friend's about to get
mangled by...

199
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,842
Shhhhhhhhhhhh! Just follow me!

200
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:51,486
Behold my super bully protection
suit of power!

201
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:57,225
Whoa!

202
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:07,270
I love it! Pshooo!

203
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:10,173
Looking good.

204
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:15,912
Now, check<i> this</i> out.
It's got bouncy bubble wrap
pants, and it has an mp3 player

205
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:19,250
as standard.

206
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:29,261
And that's not all.
This string here operates the
super counterattack device.

207
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:33,265
No, wait!
You've only got one shot, so you
must wait for the right moment.

208
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:38,204
Okay.
And last but not
least, the tassels!

209
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,909
What do these do?
Move your arm around.
Oooooh.

210
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:47,681
Tassels.
Okay.
Time to put it to the test.

211
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:53,020
Ready? Okay.

212
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:55,156
Can you feel anything yet? Aah!

213
00:16:55,158 --> 00:17:01,196
Okay.
I'll keep going.
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

214
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,699
What did it feel like?

215
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:08,270
What?

216
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:12,575
Like I'm being hit with a stick.
That wasn't much help.

217
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:17,047
That's okay.
We can rebuild it better,
faster, stronger!

218
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,952
Let's get to work! Too late.

219
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:25,990
You know what? Maybe it won't be so bad.

220
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:31,195
I'll just meet Tina in a quiet,
calm atmosphere, and we'll talk
things through like civilized

221
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,966
people. Yeah! This is a great

222
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,668
idea! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

223
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,772
This is a terrible
idea.
What's going on here?

224
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:44,611
I'll have no fighting on my
watch.
Gumball watterson.

225
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:48,881
I might have known.
Thank you, miss simian!

226
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:54,488
I was gonna fight a t-Rex.
Please send me to detention.
Well, i suppose i could...

227
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,459
after my coffee break.
But, miss simian,
Tina...

228
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:02,196
coffee break. But, miss simian,

229
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:05,634
you're my last hope! Please!

230
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:10,438
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

231
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:19,382
Where's gumball?
Here.
What am i gonna do?

232
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:23,787
What am i gonna do?!
Use the
bunny hop, son.

233
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:30,527
Son. Son. Son. Son.
Dad?
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

234
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,666
Well, i wasn't gonna miss the big fight.

235
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:40,238
Gumball!
Time to deal with
this like a man.

236
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,045
Blblblblblblblblblbl! Gumball!

237
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:50,316
Stop running! Dude, i have no idea what

238
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:53,386
- you're saying.
- Sorry!

239
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:01,028
Aaaaah!

240
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,407
Aaaah! >> Gumball!

241
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:16,712
Sorry.

242
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:19,782
Man! Sorry.

243
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:24,987
Sorry. Aaaah!

244
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,629
Ha ha! Scaredy-cat!

245
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:43,675
Mr. small! Please! Let me in!

246
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:47,479
Aaah! No! Please!

247
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,882
Let me in! >> No! Mr. small!

248
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:55,388
Go away! Aaaaaah!

249
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,695
Would you mind removing
your glasses when you're at the

250
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:04,131
table?...Yes?

251
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,434
What happened to you?!

252
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:13,875
I... Ran into a door?
That's not true.
He's being bullied!

253
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:19,548
Seriously, i<i> did</i> run into a door.

254
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,328
Mom! Calm down! I'm perfectly calm!

255
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,598
I just need a word with Mr. Rex,
honey-pie.
Gumball!

256
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,603
Sit!

257
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:46,077
You guys make up!

258
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,683
Mr. Rex. Hi, Mr. Rex.

259
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:56,556
We need to talk about your daughter.

260
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:03,062
So, it's going to be
like<i> that,</i> is it?
Well, that's fine by me!

261
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,870
Your dad is pretty scary. So's your mom.

262
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:14,775
Tina? Is it true that you're bullying me?

263
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:18,012
What? No!
I thought we were just having
fun.

264
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:22,417
So, why were you
chasing me?
I only wanted to speak to

265
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:29,558
you, but you ran away.
Everyone thinks I'm a brute,

266
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,665
just like my dad. But I'm not!

267
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,301
<i>I</i> don't think you're a brute. >> Really?

268
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:42,072
Of course.
You're just a dangerous friend
with a terrifying amount of

269
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:45,009
strength. >> Thanks! Come on.

270
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:51,315
Give me five... How about a friend hug?

271
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:54,586
Too... Friendly!

272
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:04,097
Well, I'm glad we finally
reached an agreement.
Goodbye, Mr. Rex.

273
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,609
So, everything's okay
between you and Tina?

274
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,446
Yep! Everything's just fine.
