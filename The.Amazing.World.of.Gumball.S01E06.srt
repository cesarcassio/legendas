00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
Not really.

327
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,800
Exactly!

328
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,320
Son, it's time I taught you
about weaseling.

329
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
Weaseling?

330
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,320
Allow me to demonstrate.

331
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,800
Ask me for something.

332
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,000
OK.

333
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,600
Can you tell me how to stop Carrie
from using my body?

334
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Well, I'd love to,
but I have to go and take the meatloaf

335
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,200
that I've been baking out of the oven.

336
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
End of lesson!

337
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,720
Well, I'd love to, Carrie,

338
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,480
but, unfortunately,
I have to go check on my meatloaf.

339
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Your meatloaf?

340
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,640
Yeah. I left it in my locker.

341
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
You mean this locker?

342
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
Uh, n-no.

343
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,280
My... my gym locker.

344
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,800
You don't have a gym locker.

345
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,079
Yes, I meant Jim's locker.

346
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,280
Who's Jim?

347
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,160
He's... my doctor?

348
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,960
You mean your meatloaf
is in your doctor's locker here at school?

349
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
Yeah, it's because
we're having thanksgiving here--

350
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
Whatever, you can have my body.

351
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,240
Mom, I think I might be putting on weight.

352
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Oh, no, it's just baby fat, dear.

353
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
Come on inside. We'll have a chat.

354
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,640
Oh, perhaps you have gained a little.

355
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
I know. It's Carrie.

356
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I don't know how to get her to stop.

357
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,160
Go and sit down, honey. We need to talk.

359

So, have you actually
tried saying no to Carrie?

360
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,520
Huh? "No"?

361
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
Why didn't I think of that?

362
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,440
But when you say no, you have to mean it.

363
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Let me show you.

364
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Richard, can you come here, please?

Yeah?

367
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,840
Could you get me the bowl of sausages
from the kitchen, dear?

368
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh.

369
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Can I have one?

370
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
No.

You'll have to wait.

Oh.

-Can I have it now?

No.

You have to stand firm

What about now?

378
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,440
No! That would be a bad Richard,
wouldn't it?

379
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,720
What I'm trying to say is,
just say no and mean it.

380
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Awesome.

381
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,520
So, can I have a sausage?

No? What do you mean, no?

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,160
-I mean you can't use my body anymore.
-Hmm.

No, Carrie. You cannot borrow my body.
