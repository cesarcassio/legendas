00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,520
I almost think I could put it
back on, you know,

167
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,040
just one last time and I'd be fine.

168
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,360
I reckon if I put mine back on,
it would do nothing.

Boys, is that you?

173
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,160
Oh. Yeah. Just rushing off to school.

174
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,560
You know, don't want to miss
any of those, spelling... sums.

175
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,840
That's great, honey.

176
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,840
Now, where did you put those
karate costumes?

177
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Those old things?
I completely forgot about them.

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
But you had them only yesterday.

179
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,800
That was yesterday?

180
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,600
Well, time sure flies
when you're all grown up.

181
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
Can you remember where we put them?

182
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,520
-Beats me.
-Maybe they're in the closet.

183

-Bye!
-Bye.

184
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,800
And now to get rid of
this problem once and for all.

185
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,760
They've gone!

186
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Wait a minute.

187

OK, let's get these dorky clothes off.

192
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't know.
I think I'm gonna keep mine on.

193
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,280
What?

194
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Mom's kind of right. This is a bit lame.

At lunch break, come and see me
attempt the impossible.

No. I'm going to break 12 planks of wood

No, Darwin.

I'm more sane than I've ever been!

I can't believe they lied to me!

212
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,360
I never should've given them
those outfits!

Dude, seriously,
how are you gonna do this?

220
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Easy-- I've seen loads of guys
do it on the Internet.

221
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
All I have to do is hit it with my hand.

222

Watch.

223
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Karate fans, please,
can I have a little hush?

224
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Yeah, quiet!

225
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120

Don't you guys watch TV?

If he wants to wear
karate clothes, let him!

247
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
At least he's brave enough to be himself!

Cool!

I want you to do

what your Granny Jojo tells you.

Mom, I've been talking it over
with Darwin,

290
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
and I think I'm old enough
not to have Granny Jojo

291
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
kiss me on the cheek anymore.

292
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
Why don't you want your Granny Jojo

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,800
to kiss you on the cheek?

294

Uh, I'm just not into the whole
kissing-on-the-cheek thing.

But she's your Granny Jojo.

So? Can't we just shake hands?

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,760

kiss you on the cheek!

Well, good for you, dear.
