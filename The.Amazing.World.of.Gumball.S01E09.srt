Get him off!
 Gumball: Go, dad!

264
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,005
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, dad!
You got him!

265
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,375
 Dad: Think he's on my back!
Aaaah!
 Darwin: Yeah, kick his butt,

266
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,378
dad!
 Gumball: Come on, dad!
You can take him!

267
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,948
Dad?
 Dad: Get him off!
Get him off!

268
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,850
Aah! Ow!
 Darwin: He's not winning, is
he?

269
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,220
 Gumball: No.
 Dad: What's wrong with you?
Ow! Ow!

270
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,923
Doesn't really hurt that much.
But ow!
Oh, no!

271
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,427
My beautiful face!
Gumball! Darwin!
Stop this!

272
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,831
 Gumball: Eh, this is getting
kind of embarrassing.
 Dad: No!

273
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,934
don't abandon me, please!
Ow!
Ow!

274
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,238
Ow!
Aah!
He's biting my neck with his

275
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,876
little teeth, and it tickles!
[ Laughs ]
[ Sobbing ]

276
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,579
 Gumball: Stop right there,
little man!
 Darwin: Yeah!

277
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,048
Leave Mr. dad alone!
Otherwise --
 otherwise what?

278
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,286
 Gumball: Otherwise, we'll put
the security video online.
What do you think the Internet

279
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,789
will say when it sees you
slapping your customers with
your little hands?

280
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,993
 That it's pretty funny?
 Gumball: Yeah, it<i> was</i> pretty
funny.

281
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:05,963
But you'll probably get a modest
fine and a couple of days of
community service.

282
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,532
 So?
 Gumball: So the shop will be
closed.

283
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:13,237
 And?
 Gumball: And you'll lose
money.

284
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,608
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No need to get excited.
Okay, look, i can't give you a

285
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,078
refund.
It's a matter of principle.
But since i find you quite

286
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,615
pathetic, I'll give you a 1%
discount on this new game
console.

287
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,386
That way, you can play the game
you've already got.
What do you say?

288
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:33,157
 Gumball: Hmm.
1%.
So, $700.

289
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,328
That's, like, $7 off!
 Dad: Now,<i> that's</i> what i call
a bargain!

290
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,997
 Darwin: Can we have your
credit card, Mr. dad?
 Dad: Totally.

291
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:45,736
 All: Whoo-hoo!
 Dad: Ugh!
Can't believe i got beat up by a

292
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,572
garden gnome.
 Gumball: Oh, come on.
It was pretty funny.

293
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,842
 Darwin: Like when you were
screaming, "no, no, my beautiful
face!"

294
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,813
 Gumball: And when he was
pounding on you from above and
it looked like a tennis ball

295
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,749
bouncing on a melon.
[ Laughter ]

296
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,556
 Dad: And thanks to me, we did
get a huge discount on the
console.

297
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,359
 Darwin: Come on!
Put the game on!
 Gumball: Yes!

298
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,328
[ Buzzing ]

299
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:18,836
Dad, he sold us a shredder.
 Dad: [ Sighs ]
[ Grunting ]

300
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,805
[ "Bad to the bone" plays ]
