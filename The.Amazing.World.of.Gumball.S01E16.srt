1
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,528
Aah! It's Daisy the donkey on ice day!

2
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,565
You promised to take me, and
we're late!
Honey, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:45,069
Mommy worked really late last
night.
<i>What sort of a horrible mother</i>

4
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:49,541
<i>wouldn't take her daughter to</i>
<i>her favorite show?</i>
Anais, i know what i said,

5
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,009
but... <i>Horrible mother...</i>

6
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,511
<i>Horrible mother...</i>

7
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:59,016
Okay. "Electrofat.

8
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:03,787
Gets you fit while you watch
TV."
So the last electrode goes...

00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,090
♪ Daisy the donkey ♪ Where? ♪ Daisy ♪

10
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,626
There! Hi, honey!

11
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:12,262
Hi. Where's gumball and Darwin?

12
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:16,133
In the backyard playing
their made-up game.
Keep an eye on them.

13
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:19,169
Every time they play that game,
it's a mess.

Dodge or dare!

Aah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

20
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:44,293
What was that?
Doesn't matter.
It's time to play...

Dodge or dare!
Roll the dice!
Take a card!

Dare!
You have to throw the ball onto
the moon using only objects from

23
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,304
the trash. Hah.

24
00:01:55,306 --> 00:02:00,041
Just watch and learn. Yes!

25
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:14,256
Ooh. Aah! Hey, the card says

26
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,825
"no hands." Mmmmm.

27
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:21,196
I told you, Margaret.
It's not a mid-life crisis.

28
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:24,532
It's just a new car.

29
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:28,270
It landed in the Robinson's yard. Yay!

30
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:32,574
Mr. Robinson. He's such a funny guy.

31
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,578
Mrs. Robinson is one lucky lady.

32
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:47,721
Your ball fell into my
garden, causing my wife's hair
to fall off!

33
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:52,993
Therefore, as a punishment, I'll
teach you a new game called,
um...

34
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,530
Learning the consequences of

35
00:02:56,532 --> 00:03:00,901
your actions!
A game Mr. Robinson
invented for us?

36
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:06,040
You can start by cleaning the
garden.
Yes!

37
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,175
But wait!

38
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:11,944
There you go.
You wouldn't want it to be easy,
would you?

39
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:19,819
Whoo!

40
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:24,123
We'll see if they're still
smiling after this.

41
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,461
Excuse me. There, we're done.

42
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:34,734
This is green, green-orange,
orangey green, terra-cotta,
Egyptian sunrise, sunset yellow,

43
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:39,972
and this is the Mr. Robinson
head-shaped leaf.
Ooh.

44
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:43,942
Can we keep it?
No.
You slackers forgot to cut the

45
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:46,678
grass! Mr. Robinson, you're so right.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,248
What... Were... We...
Thinking?!
We'll get right on

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,052
it.
But wait!
You got to use nail clippers.

48
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:58,557
Yay!
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.
I think they're missing the

49
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,559
- point.
- Done!

50
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:04,696
What the...?! >> Whoa!

51
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:08,567
All right, goons.
Come here and paint this fence
blue.

52
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,771
Yay!
That'll teach 'em to mess
with gaylord Robinson.

53
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:15,507
Done! >> Hmph! Now make it green! Done!

54
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,209
Orange with purple stripes!
Done!
Yellow with black dots!

55
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,844
Done! >> Pink! Done!

56
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,212
Red! Done! >> Blue!

57
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,880
Done! >> Black! Done!

58
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,749
Yellow! Done! >> Aaaaaah!

59
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:29,887
Mr. Robinson, since
you love painting so much, i
made this bird especially for

60
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,057
you. >> thanks?

61
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:36,527
Ooh, yeah.
Follow me.
Now, there's a stain on this

62
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,996
rug. Where?

63
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,632
There!

64
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:44,368
I mean, there!

65
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,672
What?! More ice, sir? >> give me that!

66
00:04:56,515 --> 00:05:00,350
What?! Okay, now you're scaring me.

67
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:04,788
I'm sure Mr.
Robinson needs more help.
Maybe he's too shy to

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,524
ask. >> Go away! He hides it well,

69
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,627
but i can feel he needs us. >> Go away!

70
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:13,062
Go away! Go awaaaaaay!

71
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:17,133
Now<i> that</i> is a cry for help.

72
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,936
Those little parasites, they
just won't...

73
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:22,405
Hi, Mr. Robinson. >> What?!

74
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,375
Don't touch me! Unbelievable.

75
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:30,112
Come on. Eat up, Mr. Robinson.

76
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,382
Get away from me! Darn those kids.

77
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:37,553
Can't a guy get some privacy in
his own house?

78
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:41,557
Blast it. Out of paper. Get out of here!

79
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,493
Wait. Could you throw that back,

80
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,262
please? I need to lie down.

81
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,098
It's bedtime, Mr. Robinson.

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,602
I think he has a temperature. Come on,

83
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:58,439
Mr. Robinson.
Say ""
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

84
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,309
Listen, kids.
Why are you trying so hard to

85
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:04,212
help me?
Because we love you,
Mr. Robinson.

86
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:08,049
But there's nothing left for
you to do!
We could clean your new

87
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:10,551
car. No way! My car is brand-new and very

88
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,254
expensive. We could clean Mrs. Robinson?

89
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,457
All right. Clean the car.

90
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,928
Yay!
But, but, but, but please be
careful with it!

91
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,398
So... Where do we start? I don't know.

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,270
I never cleaned a car before.
It doesn't matter.
Let's make Mr. Robinson proud.

93
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:33,673
Okay. Easy. Mr. Robinson said it's very

94
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:37,978
expensive. I know. I'll just...

95
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:44,384
At least things can't get any

96
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,253
worse. Aaaaaah!

97
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:50,657
You know, Margaret, maybe
those kids aren't so bad after

98
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,126
all. What are we gonna do?!

99
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:57,831
I don't know.
I've never burned a car before.
This is terrible!

100
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:02,435
We failed him!
The shame!
Can't ever show our

101
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:05,605
faces again!
We need to hide away
forever!

102
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,347
Ooh, dark. Filthy. Horrible.

103
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,084
Perfect. >> My car!

104
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:23,188
Who did this?!

105
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,492
Those kids!
I'm gonna get them for this!
Come out!

106
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:29,728
I'm calling the sheriff!
No!
They know we wrecked the car.

107
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,065
What do you mean you
wrecked the car?
Aaah!

108
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:37,136
Dad? Hi. ♪ Daisy

109
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:41,172

mom?
Why are the Robinsons talking to

110
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:45,743
the sheriff on our lawn?
I don't know, sweetie.
I think we'll just go around the

111
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,047
back.
I tell you, sheriff, it was
those kids next door, as sure as

112
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,784
i... What? We just touched it

113
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:57,555
with the sponge and it fell
apart, so we decided to hide
here forever.

114
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:02,427
Such a sad story. But it's not true!

115
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:09,801
You see, it was 9:00 this
morning, and blhlhlhlhlhlhlh.
Now come on, electrofat.

116
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:12,937
Make me beautiful! Whoo!

117
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,743
Aah! Aaaaaaah! You... Thing of... Beauty!

118
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,385
Mr. Robinson's new car.
Okay.
It's just a dink.

119
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:34,024
I'll bang it out. This may take a while.

120
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:37,561
There! Finished! Aah!

121
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,902
Blhlhlhlhlh.
So, you see, it was my fault,

122
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,138
not yours. What sound we do now?

123
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,141
Well, i think the most
responsible thing to do is to
hide here forever

124
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:55,811
And never let your mother find
out what happened.
I already

125
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,214
know. Aaaaah! Honey?

126
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:02,752
But it's not quite what
you think.
It was 9:00 this morning, and...

127
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,521
Wait! Can i do this? Blhlhlhlhlh!

128
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:08,491
♪ Daisy ♪
put the tape on, mom!
Yes, honey.

129
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:11,127
♪ Donkey Daisy ♪ Where is it? Here.

130
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:15,064
Yeah! They parked right in front of

131
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,767
our lawn.
I just didn't see it.
I was about to tell

132
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,537
Mr. Robinson, but... <i>Horrible mother...</i>

133
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,341
So, we went to see the show.
And it was great!

134
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:30,745
So, there.
It was mostly my fault.
I'm so relieved.

135
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:34,783
It was a family effort!
Darn it!
I know they're up there!

136
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:39,287
Get in there and arrest those
vandals!
Not without a warrant, sir.

137
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,891
Aaaaah!
I pay my taxes, and that pays
your salary!

138
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:46,528
Ergo, I'm your boss!
Now get in there and do your
job!

139
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,431
Please, sir! Calm down! >> All right.

140
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:55,704
I supposed i shall have to take
matters into my own hands?!
Well...

141
00:09:55,706 --> 00:10:02,376
Here come the Robinsons.
Poor Mr. Robinson.
We wrecked his beautiful new

142
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:07,147
car, and nobody has the courtesy
to apologize.
We should be ashamed

143
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,418
of ourselves!
So, let's get out
there and apologize, as a

144
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,323
family. Okay.

145
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:20,127
This is what happens when you
mess with gaylord!

146
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:24,398
This is what happens!
This is what happens!
This... Is... What... Happens!

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,502
They look kind of angry,
gumball.
Please, stop! Please!

148
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,137
Please, ma'am. Drop the duster!

149
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,372
Please! No, ma'am!

150
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:38,144
No! No! >> Aaah!

151
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:42,582

152
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:46,152
Aah!

153
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:50,890
Maybe we should give
them time to calm down.
[ Shouting

154
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,192

So, do you want to press
charges?

155
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,062
No, I'm sure they learned their lesson.

156
00:10:56,064 --> 00:11:00,466
It's too bad you have to live
next to such monsters.
don't worry,

157
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:03,069
Mr. Robinson.
We'll look out for your house
while you're gone!

158
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:07,139
Aaaah!

159
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:12,377
Such a great guy.
Well, there's one
important thing we learned

160
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:16,214
today. That electrofat machine

161
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:24,216
was worth every penny.

162
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,762
Anais, for the last

163
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:34,566
time, we just can't afford it. But why?

164
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,970
Richard, tell your daughter why
we can't go to daisyland.
We're going to

165
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:41,505
daisyland?! No! But why?

166
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:46,377
Because money doesn't
grow on trees and daisyland
tickets don't just fall from the

167
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,181
But you always say
that if you put your mind to it,

168
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:53,551
you can accomplish anything.

169
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:55,352
Dad, what are you doing?

170
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:59,490
I'm getting tickets
using the power of my mind.
That's not gonna...

171
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:04,595
Shh.

172
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:08,132
I hate to break it to
you guys, but it's not gonna
happen.

173

The world doesn't work like that.

Gumball, are you
okay?
Everything's great,

212
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,972
Darwin. Everything's just<i> peachy.</i> Okay!

213
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,143
Darwin!
don't take everything i say so
literally!

214
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,613
Okay. What about what you just said now?

215
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:20,051
Should i take that literally?
No... yes!
No.

216
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:25,556
I don't know. Talk to me.

217
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,860
I think I'm cursed.

218
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,563
Then what you need is a good
luck charm.
Guys, there are no

219
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,267
such things as lucky charms,
curses, or tickets falling from
the sky.

220
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,871
There must be a scientific
explanation for what's happening
to gumball, like there is for

221
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,274
everything.
Yeah?
How does your<i> science</i> explain

222
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,779
the magical rainbows, then?
Diffraction of light
through moisture in the

223
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,715
atmosphere. It's a sad world you live in.

224
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:57,354
Come on, gumball.
Darwin, how will i
know if it's a 4-leaf clover?

225
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,991
Simple.
They've got four leaves and
they're extremely rare.

226
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,960
Rare? They're one in a million!

227
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:08,065
Rarer that the rarest...
found one!
Top 'o the morning to ya!

228
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:14,003
Ooh. I can already feel my luck changing.

229
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:19,675
- Hey, look!
- A lucky fo...

230
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:29,318
I'm ready to take
your advice now.
I knew you'd come

231
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,721
around eventually.
Now, please tell me.
What's the scientific

232
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,891
explanation for all of this?!
There's no
explanation.

233
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:39,361
What's been happening is just a
coincidental series of
unfortunate events.

234
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:42,898
Look, I'm just gonna have to show you.

235
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,303
Okay, opening an umbrella
indoors, breaking a mirror, and
walking under a ladder are all

236
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:51,840
considered to bring extremely
bad luck.
Ha! Nonsense.

237
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:56,578
And to prove this, you're going
to perform all three tasks at
the same time.

238
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,883
You sure about this?
Mathematically, the
chance of anything else

239
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:06,688
happening to you is miniscule. Okay.

240
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:13,061
Here goes!

241
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:18,766
Wow. I guess you were right.

242
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:26,767
I guess logic and

243
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:33,547
reason just went down the drain.
Hey, guys! Guys!
I've been thinking

244
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,818
scientifically, and i think i
figured it out!
Yesterday evening, gumball and i

245
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,123
were setting the table for dinner...

246
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,092
Whoa!

247
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:56,002
Wow.
It was probably the
luckiest thing i have ever seen.

248
00:17:56,004 --> 00:18:01,407
So, according to my findings,
gumball used up all his good
luck in one day, and that's why

249
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,478
today he's left with nothing but
bad luck!
Of course!

250
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,549
That doesn't make sense, but
it's the best we got.

251
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:14,086
So, the logical conclusion to
your nonsensical theory is that
if he can survive today,

252
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:18,691
everything should be back to
normal by tomorrow!
Of course!

253
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:39,711
I'll be right back, watterson.

254
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,647
I've got some important business
to attend to.
What?! No!

255
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,784
Don't leave me!
You're staying right there
because you're in detention!

256
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:48,320
No!
You don't understand!
I'm in great danger!

257
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,189
You're in great danger of
getting another three hours
detention!

258
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:55,227
Principal brown! Please!

259
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:06,237
I got to get out of here!
No, wait!
Just do nothing.

260
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:09,373
Just do nothing. Just do...

261
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,879
Sorry, i forgot to slam the
door in anger!

262
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,717
Aah!

263
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:34,198
Aah!

264
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,001
Okay, i think i might go and do
nothing somewhere else!

265
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,837
I'm so glad i confiscated this.
Watterson!

266
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:46,009
What are... Aah!

267
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:49,879
Come on, bad luck!
Let's get this over with!

268
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,950
Give me your best shot!
Raaaaaaaaaah!
No! No!

269
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:59,889
Okay! Sorry! I'm sorry!

270
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm alive!

271
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:06,429
Aaaaah!

272
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:14,430
Aw, give me a break!

273
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,411
Aah! Aah! Aaaah!

274
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:40,488
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

275
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:47,968
- In your face, bad luck!
- I am invinci...!

276
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,809
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

277
00:20:54,811 --> 00:21:00,014
No, i can make this! I'm gonna make it!

278
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:04,418
I'm gonna make it!
I'm gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it!

279
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:15,162
- What happened?
- The doctor says you were

280
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:17,631
very lucky to survive... very
lucky indeed.

281
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,399
Lucky?

282
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:21,968
This means my good luck has
finally returned!

283
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,971
Thus proving my
scientific hypothesis to be

284
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:27,307
- correct.
- And since science and

285
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:30,677
reason have gone out the window,
i suggest we use the power of

286
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:38,451
our minds to get tickets for daisyland.

287
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:42,155
One family pass to daisyland, please.

288
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,224
No! My... my ticket! D'

289
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:47,694
Well, i wonder to where the wind
will take it.

290
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:53,665
Hey, a daisyland ticket!

291
00:21:53,667 --> 00:22:00,272
I wonder to where the wind will take it.

292
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:03,108
Look, mother.

293
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:09,214
A daisyland ticket.
Mother, I'm wondering to where
the wind will take it.

294
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,427
Yay! I wished for snow!
