1
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:29,803
And that's why you should
never mix pop rocks and soda.

2
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,706
Okay... Anyone else have a riveting tale?

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,776
<i>I</i> do!
Richard, let's hear from the children.

4
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:38,612
Well, penny asked me out on a date.
No biggie.

5
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:41,716
She did?! That's great news!
What did she say?

6
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:45,887
Well... Excuse me... what?!
Do you want to come 'round my

7
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:49,557
house this Saturday? Me?
With you? At your place?

8
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,963
You see, it's Mr. cuddles'...

9
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:59,667
Yeah, that's about it.
My little boy is becoming a man.

10
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:04,974
Mom! Man, you're my hero.

11
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:09,445
You're going on this big date, and you're
not even nervous! I'd be freaking out!

12
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:14,216
I mean, think about it... if you blow it, she'll
never speak to you again, and you'll be left

13
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:19,488
alone for the rest of your life and never
find happiness! don't worry, sweetie.

14
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,558
Just be yourself.
That's all a girl wants.

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,194
Thanks, mom. See you after work. Bye!

16
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:31,968
What? Listen, son,
ignore everything your mother just

17
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,771
said. Why? Look, women only<i> think</i>

18
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,542
they want us to be ourselves because they
don't know how wretched we actually are.

19
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:42,212
What you have to do is think of someone
really cool and attractive and be them.

20
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:47,083
R-really? But... but, anais, is this true?
I'm gonna have to go

21
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:50,220
with dad on this one.
You're kind of a loser, gumball. Exactly.

22
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:53,256
Sorry. What am i gonna do?
I really like penny.

23
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:57,862
I want her to like me, too. You could
start by being romantic, dress up a

24
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:01,866
little, buy her some presents.
Well, i can't do any of those things.

25
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:06,137
I don't have any money. Listen, son,
you don't need money to show a girl a good

26
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,973
time. You think<i> i</i> have money?...No?

27
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,475
Do you see mom leaving me?
Yeah, every day to

28
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:15,213
go to work and earn money.
There's other ways to get stuff

29
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:20,051
without spending money. Do you want to hear
the secrets kept for centuries by watterson

30
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,788
men? I... Don't have any choice, do i?

31
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,992
No! Come with me.
First things first... we need to

32
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:30,596
get you some nice clothes.
Yeah, penny loves fashion!

33
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,833
That's a great idea! Here we are...
the greatest department store in the

34
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:42,835
world, where everything is free!
So, anything new?

35
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,711
Whoo! That's nice. What?
You're going to get my date

36
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:48,748
clothes out of a dump?
Man, that's gross. I didn't hear you

37
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,351
complaining when i gave you that sweater.
What?!

38
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:54,254
My favorite sweater came out of the dump?!
No.

39
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:59,158
Don't be silly.
I found it in a sewage outlet. Man.

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,998
I wear this all the time.
You are gonna look smashing.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,468
You think so? Right.
You've got the look, but you're

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,839
going to need a bit of money in your pocket so
you can treat her on the date, and I'm going to

43
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:16,210
show you a great way
of getting money for free.

44
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:21,949
Behold... the credit card!
I simply take this magic card,

45
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:26,520
insert it like so,
type in the secret magic number that mom

46
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:31,625
told me, and money comes out of
the little mouth! It works every ti...

47
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:36,964
choo!

48
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:41,836
You see? Here you go, son. Awesome!

49
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:45,707
Hey, hey, beautiful. Hey, penny.
I didn't see you there.

50
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,445
Yeah, i was just passing by...
you know, chillin' with my new hat.

51
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:54,683
Ha ha. I think I'm ready for my date.
Are you?

52
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,585
Have you even considered how
you're gonna behave on this date?

53
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:01,356
Yeah, I'm probably gonna be well-behaved.
I mean, like, manners

54
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:04,560
and etiquette. U... Aah!

55
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:08,631
Start by pouring Mrs. pumpernickel
a cup of tea. I don't wanna.

56
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:12,535
Why? 'Cause she's looking at me funny.

57
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:16,405
See? Gumball, she's a doll.
Why don't you try having a

58
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:20,910
civilized conversation with her?
All right. So, how was your day,

59
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:25,147
Mrs. pumpernickel? I see.
Too good to talk to me?

60
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,818
You think you're better than
me with your fancy, little cups and

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,889
"la-de-da" friends? Well, you know
nothing about life, Mrs. pumpernickel!

62
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:38,995
And this is what i do
to your fancy China!

63
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:43,300
Gumball, just get out of my room.
Okay, so, I'm set.

64
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:46,269
Got my look, i know where I'm taking her.
I'm ready to go.

65
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,906
There's<i> one</i> thing you're not ready for.
What's that?

66
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,942
This! What was that?

67
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:56,514
The unexpected,
and you weren't prepared for it.

68
00:04:56,516 --> 00:05:01,352
I-i see what you mean.
Follow me to the training camp.

69
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:04,021
Where? Just come to the backyard.

70
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:07,725
You've got to be prepared for anything on
this date, because anything could happen.

71
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:11,229
Like what?
What if someone tries to<i> mug</i> you?!

72
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,631
I don't know. Call the police?

73
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,834
Wrong. Knock his block off! Enh.

74
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,605
Like that? That was good.
But it's better to finish with a

75
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:24,076
wisecrack. Women<i> love</i> that. Like what?

76
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:30,082
Like "welcome to punch town...
population, you." Are you sure this is

77
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:33,085
gonna help me with my date?
Totally. Okay.

78
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:37,556
Hi. I'm penny's father, and i don't
approve of you because you don't

79
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,993
have any prospects. Hah!
I'm sorry, daddy, but you're

80
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,729
grounded. Hello.

81
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:48,435
I'm Sebastian lonkwin,
penny's successful ex-boyfriend. Hah!

82
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:51,805
Looks like this "ex" is catching some z's.
Is

83
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:55,241
that all you got?! What do you say to
someone who doesn't believe in love?

84
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:59,479
Hah! You don't need that heart.
Actually, that was a

85
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:05,018
little too extreme, but I'll give you
an 8 out of 10. Good job, soldier.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,057
The hardest part of my
job is watching them leave.

87
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,595
So? Son! You look like a million bucks!

88
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:18,933
I'm proud of you, buddy.
Did you remember to... hah!

89
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:23,571
Very good, because i thought
you were gonna be<i> surprised!</i> Okay.

90
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:27,475
But will you be prepared for...
third surprise?! That one was pretty

91
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:30,377
obvious, dude. This is gonna be the

92
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:36,717
greatest date ever! Hey.

93
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:41,756
Thanks for coming, gumball.
You look... Dressed.

94
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,427
I guess you should come in.
Well, that's one way to get in the house.

95
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:48,930
Right. So, what do you want

96
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,567
to do today? >> Today is the funeral.

97
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,705
For Mr. cuddles, my pet. Thank goodness.
I thought it might be a<i> real</i>

98
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,809
funeral. I... Mean, pets... pets are

99
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:07,316
great, like part of the family. So, what
happened to him? My dad flushed him down the

100
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:10,520
toilet by mistake. That's terrible.

101
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:15,124
Did he go 'round and 'round
or straight down? Straight down.

102
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:19,262
I'm penny's father. Wah-hah! Blocked.

103
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:23,132
Right. Come to the backyard.
The service is about to start.

104
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:26,869
Penny, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a date.

105
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,339
Why didn't you tell me it was a funeral?
I did, in the corridor at

106
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,710
school. Do you want to come to my house?
It's Mr. cuddles' funeral.

107
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:38,749
I could use some support from a friend.
Gumball, are you even listening?

108
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,686
This Saturday, 4:00 P.M.
it's... it's a date.

109
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:46,557
Yeah.

110
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:49,459
Don't worry.
I'm still here for you, penny.

111
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,396
- >> Thanks, gumball.
- Awesome!

112
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:57,936
Day for remembering those
who have left us. Shall we go?

113
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:08,146
Gumball, perhaps you'd
like to say a few words about

114
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:14,719
Mr. cuddles. O-of course.
Well, Mr. cuddles was penny's

115
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:19,624
pet. Even though i never met him,
penny's pretty hot, so I'm sure

116
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:25,164
he was pretty hot, too.
Thank you, gumball.

117
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,934
That was really special. >> My picture!

118
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:32,805
My sister made a photo tribute so
we can all remember Mr. cuddles.

119
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:38,544
Aw, how thoughtful.
Want to see? Aaaaaaaaaaah!

120
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:43,315
A spider! Knock his block off! That's awful!
I hate spiders! Who would want something that

121
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:48,421
creepy in their house? Ew, ew, ew!

122
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:54,928
Listen, son, i think it's best you leave.

She's never gonna forgive me

143
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,522
In the toilet somewhere.
Gumball, this is amazing.

144
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,792
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
Son, i stand corrected.

145
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:33,530
I thought you were a good-for-nothing,
young troublemaker, but no, you're...

146
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,934
Yeah, whatever. One question...
is that spider poisonous?

147
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,737
'Cause it just bit me.
Yeah, but it's like a bee sting.

148
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,773
You'd have to be bitten, like,
150 times for it to be dangerous.

149
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,609
Okay, thanks.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go now.

150
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,611
Bye.

151
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,287
He looks real bad. Disgusting.

152
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,191
He looks awful.
He'll never play the clarinet again.

153
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,962
Shh, shh, shh. He's waking up.

154
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,999
Looking good, champ.
Someone's here to see

155
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,736
you, honey. >> Hi, gumball. Hey,

156
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,373
penny. I brought someone
along who wants to say "sorry."

157
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,977
Right, Mr. cuddles?

158
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:59,152
Come on, you guys! We're gonna be late!

159
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:02,289
Remind me again exactly why
we're at school on a Saturday.

160
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,624
Are you kidding me? It's club day.

161
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,828
It's the only day of the week when i
get to hang out with people i really like.

162
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,031
What?! Got to go!

163
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:15,670
Okay... See you all back here at 5:00.
But wait!

164
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:20,341
<i>I</i> don't have a club to go to!
Well, mom, looks like it's your lucky day.

165
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:23,778
I'm coming with you to your
anger-management club. That's sweet,

166
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,049
gumball, but behind this door, I'm a very
different person. Trust me, you don't want to see

167
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:31,652
this. Hello, Nicole. Welcome to... aaach!

168
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:35,089
Uuuuuh.
Could you guys keep it down a little?

169
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:37,992
<i>You</i> keep it down!! Hey, anais.

170
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,929
What club are you in?
Physics club. Well, today's your

171
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,398
lucky day, because i...
Let me stop you right there.

172
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,501
You know there are different
types of intelligence? Yeah.

173
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:49,605
I don't think you have <i>any</i> of them.
I don't get it.

174
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,174
Exactly. Come on! Let me in!

175
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,877
Don't be a club hog!

176
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,514
Fine. Dad, can i join your fantasy club?

177
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:02,384
Who be therrre? It's me... gumball.

178
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,455
Be you orc? No. Be you dwarf?

179
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:09,859
No, I'm your son. Be you bearer
of savory snacks for the elders?

180
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,262
What? No. Then begone!

181
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:15,398
What's up? Man, there's got to

182
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,167
be a club for me somewhere.
You could always join <i>my</i> club.

183
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:21,704
What is it? Synchronized swimming!

184
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:30,580
You're good, but i can do better.

185
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:36,086
Here comes the swan
dive of eternal beauty!

186
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:54,471
So, how graceful was that?
Dude, you can't swim.

187
00:13:54,473 --> 00:14:01,346
Fair point...
Has anyone seen my trunks? Yeaaah!

188
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,382
Touchdown! >> All right! >> Slam-dunk!

189
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:08,653
Yeeaaaahh! Hey, guys.
Is this the football club?

190
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:11,323
Yeeaaahh! Well, did i miss the game?

191
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:14,092
No, it's going on right out there.
Why aren't you

192
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,261
playing? 'Cause we're the reserve team!

193
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:19,197
Cool. So, can i join? >> I don't know.

194
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,566
Are you man enough? Me?

195
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:25,438
I'm at least 50% man.
Well, in that case, here's your towel.

196
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,774
Thanks. So...
Do you guys ever get to play?

197
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:33,179
Nah, we just hang out here and
act kinda sporty. You guys just take

198
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:36,082
showers, hang around in towels,
and high-five each other? Heh!

199
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:41,087
There's a little bit
more to it than that.

200
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,589
Aah! Okay!

201
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,691
Okay, okay!

202
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,033
Hey, Hector, is the game over?

203
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,703
Yeah. We lost. >>.

204
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,407
What?

205
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:04,778
Aaaahhh! Aah. Aah.

206
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,515
Heh.

207
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:12,619
Why doesn't anyone want me in their club?
It can't have anything to do

208
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,458
with me... my talent, my intelligence,
or my general awesomeness.

209
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,030
You know what? Too bad for you jealous
people, 'cause I'm starting my own club,

210
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:27,035
and you are not invited! Okay, I'd like to
welcome everyone to "gumball's club of

211
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:30,872
gumball." First order of business...
attendance.

212
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,708
Pretty good. Now, it seems like recently

213
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,813
we've been let down by certain... Family
members. So i propose a little exercise

214
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,818
in trust. Okay, don't worry, gumball.
Just close your eyes, let

215
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,957
yourself fall back, and someone will catch
you. Well, I'm a bit scared, gumball.

216
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,228
Well, that's why it's called a
trust exercise. Come on, dude.

217
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,033
Okay.

218
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:05,007
All in favor of disbanding the club,
say "aye." Aye.

219
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,945
Motion carried. Aw, man.
I'm such a reject.

220
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,915
I wish there was a club for
people like me that no one liked.

221
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:16,920
I'd join<i> that</i> club in a second.
I wouldn't even care what it was about.

222
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:25,628
What's going on?

223
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,699
Look no further, fellow loser.
What the...?

224
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:33,037
We are the unloved, the weird.

225
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,442
Let me introduce you to...
The reject club!

226
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:42,746
Always accepting new members. Thanks.

227
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:45,683
I'm desperate, but not<i> that</i> desperate.
No, wait!

228
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,453
We really need new members. We're so bored
of talking to each other, we've been phoning

229
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,556
up the speaking clock for conversation.
If you want, you could be our

230
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,360
president or something. Or...
or... or even better, our king!

231
00:16:56,362 --> 00:17:00,765
Picture this...
gumball watterson, king of the rejects!

232
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:04,903
What? King of the rejects?

233
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:08,273
Seriously?
Thanks for the offer, guys, but

234
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,943
it's a "no." King of the rejects.

235
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:15,780
He rejected us.
And laughed at our loneliness.

236
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:19,985
Well, we'll see if he's still too good
for us when we've finished with him.

237

be able to do things on your own.

241
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:36,169
There must have been <i>one</i> club

club. But i politely declined.

Aaaaah! It's okay.
It landed in the vegetables.

Aaaah! The cake! Look...
there's a DVD tied to it.

<i>Greetings, gumball watterson,

Now the nerds are bullying me.

255

I guess you want me to
deal with <i>this</i> on my own. No.

256
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,792
When someone picks a fight with <i>one</i> of us,
they pick a fight with<i> all</i> of us.

257
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:33,828
Everybody, get in the car.
We've still got time to stop them.

258
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,400
But where is their secret hideout?
It's in the library!

259

Noooo! It's locked!

My reputation is ruined! No, not yet.
Quick... someone make me angry.

Let the battle commence!

Hurrah! I get the first shot.
Meteor sword! Eugh! Ooh!

turns. Come on!
The computer's just up ahead!

272
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:44,535
Watch out!

273
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:49,573
Relax.

274
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:53,511
It's only bobert. I can take him.
Initiating combat mode.

Aaaaaahhh!

276

Don't worry, guys. I got this.

277
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:10,796
- Ehhhhhhhhhhh...
- What are you doing?

278
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,564
Leave it to me. Just go around him.

279
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,366
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

280
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:17,202
Don't worry.
The power of physics has never

The computer!

283
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:34,887
This is our chance to stop the upload.
<i>30 seconds to completion.</i>

284
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:39,158
There's a guard! Wsshhh! Wsh! Wsh! Wsh!

285

Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
! That guy looks pretty

286
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,797
dangerous. What are we gonna do?

287
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,435
Leave it to me. Wsh! Wsh! Come on, punk.

288
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:53,407
Let's dance.

289
00:20:57,145 --> 00:21:01,382
Such grace! The rhythm...

290
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:08,322
Must... Synchronize! Thanks, buddy.
<i>5 seconds to completion.</i>

291
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:12,226
Yes! My reputation is safe.
<i>4 seconds till completion.</i>

292
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,696
Aaaah! >><i> 3 seconds.</i>

293
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:18,933
<i>2 seconds. 1 second till completion.</i>

294
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:25,073
<i>Upload complete.</i> Nooooooooooo!

295
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,710
<i>Sending to all school contacts.
My name is</i>

296
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:33,348
<i>gumball Trisha watterson. That's right...
Trisha is my middle name, and i was born</i>

297
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,452
<i>without eyebrows and need to draw them on
every day. On hot days, i smell like pâté,</i>

298
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:40,990
<i>and teachers are advised not to
mention it. Also, i have a glandular</i>

299
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,726
<i>problem that causes...</i> Okay! Okay.

300
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:46,829
You win. I'll join your club.
Are you kidding?

301
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:49,498
Have you seen your school record?
We're desperate, but we're not

302
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,601
<i>that</i> desperate. Great.

303
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:58,908
Rejected by the reject club. Well,
that's my reputation ruined until college.

304
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,179
No, it isn't. I counter-hacked the main
school server and rerouted the e-mail

305
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:06,683
before it got to anyone. Thank you, sis.

306
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:10,287
Don't worry. We'll always be
there for you. You're part of the

307
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,758
watterson club... Trisha.
Yeah, and whose great idea was<i> that?</i>

308
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,361
What's wrong with it? It's short for
"tristopher." Richard, i thought we

309
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:22,232
agreed on "Christopher." Christopher,
tristopher... same thing, right?

310
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:25,502
So, what shall we do with<i> these</i> guys?
Well, i think the

311
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:29,506
responsible thing to do would be to drive them
home and tell their parents what they've done.

312
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:33,311
No? Then how about we spray you in

313
00:22:33,313 --> 00:22:36,681
honey and drop you off in
the bear cage at the zoo?

314
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:42,253
Okay, maybe you'd prefer to
be dropped off naked at the mall?

315
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:46,657
All those in favor, say "aye." Aye!

316
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:47,659
Motion carried.
