ï»¿1
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:36,376
Can you think of any better
way to spend our lives?

2
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:38,856
Dude, I can't even think.

3
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:41,096
Has my heart stopped beating?

4
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:49,296
Keep flicking.

5
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:52,696
LISTEN, GUM, BALL, THE WORLD,

6
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:56,016
WILL END IN 24 HOURS, SO LOOK FOR THE SIGNS

7
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,576
That was strange.

8
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,416
Yeah.

9
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:01,456
Keep flicking.

10
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:15,356
THE END IS NEAR! THE END IS NEAR!
THE END IS NEAR! THE END IS NEAR!

11
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,856
For our discount sale, so hurry up.

12
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,636
That's weird. Where do you
think all those birds are going?

13
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:33,556
What?

14
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,876
You want my sandwich?

15
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,036
Here, you can have it.

16
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,996
Please let me go!

17
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,076
Okay, there's something going on here.

18
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,196
Yeah, first there was this
weird message from the TV.

19
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,756
Then, the weird guy with the sign.

20
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,536
And now the animals are acting weird.

21
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:54,536
What's going on?

22
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,176
Greetings organic units,

23
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:00,536
would you be interested in signing
up for the science club excursion

24
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:03,496
to watch the solar eclipse
in exactly 24 hours?

25
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,736
24 hours?

26
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,036
Uh, what exactly happens
in a solar eclipse?

27
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:11,536
The Sun will be engulfed
by the Moon and the world

28
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:14,276
will be thrust into complete
and unnatural darkness.

29
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:18,436
Whoa, uh, and uh, is this gonna be like...
like a bad thing?

30
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:21,636
Well, the Mayans believed that it
would signify the end of the world,

31
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,116
but, of course,
that was before the advent of science.

32
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,956
THE END OF THE WORLD!!

33
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,856
Yes, but obviously,
it's just primitive nonsense...

34
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,036
IN 24 HOURS!!

35
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,196
Please let me finish...

36
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,436
WE'RE DOOMED!!

37
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,316
I'll take that as a "yes".

38
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,836
24 HOURS?! Oh, this is horrible!

39
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:47,076
All the things I wanted to do in my
life, all my plans...

40
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,576
Ruined! RUINED!!!

41
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:53,936
You know, I've been thinking...

42
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,356
24 hours is actually quite a lot of time.

43
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,216
Hey, you're right!

44
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,436
I mean, how many minutes
are there in an hour?

45
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:00,376
Like 60?

46
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:03,816
So, that's like 60 times 24, which is...

47
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,636
Three billion seconds!

48
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:07,756
That's like ages!

49
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,756
We've got to make every second count!

50
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,776
You know, Darwin, I've never asked you,
what do you wanna do with your life?

51
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,256
What are your hopes and dreams?
Who is Darwin Watterson?

52
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,836
Well, I guess, that makes me
happy is helping other people

53
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:24,916
who are less fortunate than ourselves due
the circumstances beyond their control.

54
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,056
So I'd like to start a charity for...

55
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:28,536
Where are you going?

56
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:31,476
Dude, I don't think the end of the
world is time to get charitable.

57
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,276
And besides,
you're getting a kind of boring.

58
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:36,276
I think we're better off doing
some of the things I wanna do.

59
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,516
Darwin, what are we doing here?

60
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:46,816
Learning hard, so we can get a career,
a home and feed our children in the future.

61
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,896
Darwin! There is no future!

62
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,196
We need to make the most of it right now!

63
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:54,436
No listening some baboon
drone on about algebra!

64
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,776
Gumball, this is biology.

65
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:00,756
Oh, who cares?! It won't matter
in 24 hours! Kiss me, Penny!

66
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:05,236
I've got a surprise for you
today, children.

67
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,036
A surprise test!

68
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,416
Well, I've got a surprise for you!

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,596
I'm not gonna do the test because...

70
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:19,916
It's the end of the world,
and nothing matters anymore!

71
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,056
Not even this!

72
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:26,056
How's that for a surprise?

73
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:29,616
So, come on, everybody,
let's turn our last day on Earth

74
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:32,716
into the biggest...
party... EVER!

75
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,193
OK, on second thoughts,
spending three hours

76
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,340
on detention wasn't the
best use of our time.

77
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,256
I'm gonna be late for my wedding now.

78
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:52,936
Wedding?

79
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,936
Yes Darwin, my wedding.

80
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,296
By the power of the banana,
it is my duty to ask

81
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,859
if there's anyone here
that has any reason why

82
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,780
Gumball and Penny should
not be joined in marriage.

83
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,056
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

84
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,976
Actually, I've got more than one reason.

85
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,236
Firstly, I'm 12 and so are you.

86
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,526
Secondly, you didn't even
propose to me,

87
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,840
you're just trying to marry
me in the school corridor.

88
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:15,836
Hey, guys!

89
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,236
Happy wedding!

90
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:20,116
And finally, this is not a wedding ring.

91
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:21,436
It's a bagel.

92
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:22,676
But you know what?

93
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,356
That shouldn't stop you for
asking me again in 20 years.

94
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,976
Oh, but you don't have 20 years.

95
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,556
Shhh... I love her too much
to let her know the truth.

96
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:36,176
Hey, wanna get married?

97
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,056
Gumball, why do you have a perm?

98
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,856
It's just something I've
always wanted to do.

99
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:48,756
So, mom, under normal circumstances, how
long do you reckon I'm going to live for?

100
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:52,936
Well, your grandfather lived to be
102, so I wouldn't worry sweetie.

101
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,476
Hmm. That's at least 90
more birthday presents.

102
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:58,716
Mom, I'd like to make you
an offer you can't refuse:

103
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:03,516
I wanna combine all of my birthday
presents in one manageable lump present.

104
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,516
So, can I have a pony after dinner?

105
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:08,576
What are you laughing at?

106
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,056
Nothing.

107
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,116
Do you want a tutu with that?

108
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:16,196
If I get you a pony,
you'll get bored of it in a day.

109
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:16,916
Not an issue.

110
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,916
Okay... I'll get you a pony.

111
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,076
Thank you, finally!

112
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,876
As soon as your father
starts laying golden eggs.

113
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,396
I haven't given up yet!

114
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,356
All right. I was going to spare
you, guys, but...

115
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:33,556
Okay...

116
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:37,736
This morning, the TV spoke to
me, and here's what it said,

117
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,736
"Dark times are upon us...

118
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:46,356
burns everything it touches to ash".

119
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:50,116
So, basically, there's gonna
be the solar eclipse, and...

120
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,616
it's gonna be the end of the world.

121
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,036
No one believes us.

122
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,396
Have you tried to do something about it?!

123
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:06,776
Well, Gumball got a perm
and tried to get married.

124
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,776
I mostly ate ice-cream
on a roller-coaster.

125
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,336
That's not what I'm talking about!

126
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,036
We need to plan our survival!

127
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,556
Apocaly-dips or not,

128
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:18,716
the Wattersons will LIVE ON!!!

129
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:21,236
Come on, come on! We need to go faster!!

130
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:26,556
Dad, I think you need to
take the handbrake off.

131
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,616
GOOD IDEA!

132
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,356
Dad, you're in reverse.

133
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,116
CORRECT!

134
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:35,316
LET'S WALK!

135
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:39,156
First thing to do in an emergency is
to panic and buy everything you can.

136
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,536
Hey! No running in the supermarket.

137
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,696
Ok! Let's race walk.

138
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,356
This is pretty effective.

139
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,056
Well, it's an Olympic event, you know?

140
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,616
Now, you grab as much food as possible!

141
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,716
AH! Queue! We don't have time for that!

142
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,876
Look dad! The self-service aisle!

143
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:13,276
Unexpected items in the bagging area.

144
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,116
Please try scanning it more slowly.

145
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:21,736
Insufficient scanning speed.
Please try scanning faster.

146
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,316
A little bit faster.

147
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:25,316
A little bit faster.

148
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,536
A little bit faster.

149
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,236
Scan successful.

150
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:28,916
YES!

151
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,156
Item unrecognized.

152
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:35,516
Unexpected item in cranium area.
Please rescan.

153
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,196
Insufficient scanning speed.

154
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:43,956
Hey! Come back here!
You didn't pay for that!

155
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,776
Dad, is this really necessary?

156
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,023
Absolutely.
In every disaster movie I've ever

157
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:52,416
seen, the family survives
by hiding in a bunker.

158
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,856
Richard, that's not a bunker.
It's a toilet.

159
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,636
C'mon, guys. Think outside the box.

160
00:08:57,896 --> 00:09:01,476
This's got everything
we need: a toilet, a...

161
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,656
I don't think we're all
going to fit in there.

162
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:06,676
We have to.

163
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,336
Dad, for the last time,
there won't be any apocalypse.

164
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:12,796
 It's just an eclipse.

165
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,896
Apocaly-gyps, apocaly-clips...

166
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,896
It's all the same smarty-pants.

167
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:20,716
I think this might be easier
if you left the TV outside.

168
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:25,416
Nicole, you're describing a
world I do not wish to live in.

169
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,616
I'll sacrifice myself.

170
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:30,052
Look, honey, why don't you
and the boys stay in here

171
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,940
and keep acting
complete lunatics,

172
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:35,196
while Anais and I sit outside
and watch the eclipse?

173
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,576
Boys, what do you think you're doing?

174
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,076
We're sacrificing ourselves
for your survival.

175
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:46,256
After the apocalypse, you guys,
will have to repopulate the Earth.

176
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:50,756
Tell the children of the future
of our heroism, our sacrifice.

177
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,156
And our perm!

178
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,616
We love you!

179
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,416
Gumball Watterson,
come back here immediately!

180
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,136
I'm not spending the afternoon in a toilet!

181
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:05,616
This is it, buddy.

182
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:09,376
I'm proud of spending my lasts
moments with you, Gumball.

183
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,036
Me too.

184
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:14,716
Here it comes.

185
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:37,056
Duuuude, you just got moooooned!

186
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,656
What is wrong with that guy?

187
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,716
That was a bit anti-climatic.

188
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:45,656
Yeah.

189
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,865
But at least we've
learned something today,

190
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,416
that every moment of our life
should be lived to the fullest,

191
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,616
because it can be very long
or very short, my friend.

192
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,476
That is very true, Gumball.

193
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:57,616
So, what do you wanna do now?

194
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:00,156
TV?

195
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:01,056
Yeah.

196
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,096
Richard, do something!

197
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:09,536
Don't worry, girls,
I've been in this situation before!

198
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,536
I'm going to kick the door open.

199
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,556
Yup, that's exactly
what happened last time.

200
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:59,843
Gumball, Darwin!
C'mon, we're gonna be late for school!

201
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:01,323
Be there in a second.

202
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:05,443
Ok. By my calculations, these ice cubes
will allow us to glide down stairs

203
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,723
at almost the speed of light! Go!

204
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,963
Awesome!...

205
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:12,923
Ready!

206
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,083
You can't go to school like that!

207
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,343
You're naked!

208
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:17,763
But I can't find my clothes.

209
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:20,543
Dad!

210
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,543
Morning, son!

211
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,243
Why are you sleeping in the garden?

212
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:29,143
Because I've been up all night doing the
laundry, just like your mother asked me to.

213
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:31,763
Whatever you do, don't do the laundry.

214
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,363
Aye, aye, captain!

215
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,983
Great! Can I have my clothes?

216
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:35,823
Of course.

217
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,883
Here you go!

218
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:40,883
They're so tiny.

219
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,683
And so clean.

220
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,583
Kinda tight, too.

221
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,223
You know how your mom
feels about public nudity!

222
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:53,843
Not to worry.

223
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:56,183
I've got just the thing!

224
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:01,903
Here you go!

225
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:03,283
What?

226
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:04,863
Mom's wedding dress?

227
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:06,023
I can't wear that!

228
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,023
But everything else is in the wash!

229
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,023
I'd rather go naked!

230
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:14,603
But if you do, your mother will know
I'm a terrible father-slash-husband!

231
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:15,783
Please son!

232
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,383
Do this for your own dad!

233
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,163
Okay, I'll wear the dress...

234
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:27,683
Thanks son!

235
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,683
I can't believe this!

236
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,423
I can't believe this
wardrobe's still standing...

237
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,043
Here we go!

238
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,663
Gumball! What are you wearing?

239
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:48,383
Dad ruined all my clothes and
made me wear that stupid dress!

240
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:51,323
I can not let anyone recognize me.

241
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,003
Who are you?

242
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,443
My name is...

243
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,023
Quick! Think the name... Think the name...

244
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,963
Gum, ball-- Oops!

245
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,363
Egg...

246
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,103
Wobble-

247
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:09,283
Underpants!

248
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:12,863
Is that a foreign name?

249
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:14,603
Yes! Yes! I'm...

250
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,343
uh... from... uh... Europe!

251
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,003
Where in Europe?

252
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:24,743
Gum... Bald... No!

253
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:29,523
 Wig! ...Battleaxe? ...Ninja!

254
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:41,943
Can you believe that, Darwin?

255
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:44,303
Darwin?

256
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,523
She dropped her button...

257
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:50,703
Oh, boy.

258
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:55,923
Ok, Ok. Settle down and
take out your math homework.

259
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,643
Tss. I forgot to do my homework.
Can I copy yours?

260
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:06,703
You can copy mine.

261
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:06,883
No, mine! You can copy mine.

262
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:07,643
No, mine!

263
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:08,403
How about mine?

264
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,203
Well, well, well.

265
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,683
You are not trying to
cheat, are you Gum...?

266
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,323
Who are you?

267
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,683
I'm... a... I'm...

268
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,183
That's GumBallOopsEggWobbleUnderpants!

269
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,183
From GumBaldNoWigBattleaxeNinja!

270
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,263
That's in Europe!

271
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:25,983
Quiet!

272
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:29,623
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

273
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:40,283
But you're wearing a beautiful
dress, so it must be true.

274
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:43,483
Why don't you sit there and look pretty?

275
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,963
While the rest of us get on with class!

276
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,563
What just happened?

277
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,123
I'm so happy!

278
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,423
Anais!

279
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,883
The most wonderful, incredible,
amazing thing has happened!

280
00:15:59,283 --> 00:15:59,883
What?

281
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,883
I'm in looove!

282
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:06,583
She's the most beautiful, most wonderful,
most amazing, most wonderful, most...

283
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,443
Here she comes!

284
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:15,003
Stop! There's a puddle!
We can't let you walk through that!

285
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,003
Let me help...

286
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:18,823
No! Let my fly you over...

287
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:19,803
I could build you a bridge...

288
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,983
No! Let me carry you in my mouth!

289
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:26,843
I can just walk around... Like this.

290
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,643
Oh! She's so clever...

291
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:29,543
So independent!

292
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,423
What a free thinker!

293
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:33,723
What was all that about?

294
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:35,143
It's the dress.

295
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:35,863
What?

296
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,203
They think you're a beautiful girl.

297
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,863
People'll do anything for a beautiful girl!

298
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,263
Anything!

299
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,943
You're right! I am beautiful!

300
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,483
You really go once for a genius, sis!

301
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,603
She will be mine!

302
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:59,363
That was weird...

303
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:02,563
Oh, well! Today is gonna be awesome!

304
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:08,943
âª She's as cool as nighttime, âª
âª She's as bright as day. âª

305
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:12,343
âª When she looks in your eyes, âª
âª She takes your breath away. âª

306
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:15,443
âª She could move a mountain, âª
âª Make a fire start. âª

307
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,803
âª On a smaller scale, âª
âª She could break your heart. âª

308
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:22,023
âª She's a lady! âª
âª A fine lady! âª

309
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:25,503
âª She looks like an angel, âª
âª She's sent from above. âª

310
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,543
âª She's a lady! âª
âª A super lady! âª

311
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:33,823
âª And with this kitten I'm smitten, âª
âª I'm bitten by the bug they call love! âª

312
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:38,163
âª Now the lady may be mine. âª

313
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:42,703
âª Yeah, the lady may be mine. âª

314
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,583
Thanks, guys!

315
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,163
Yeah, no problem!

316
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,003
Any time!

317
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,003
Gumball, what's going on?

318
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:48,883
It's just like you said!

319
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:51,963
All day long people have been
bending over backwards for me!

320
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,943
Hey, new girl! How's it going?

321
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:57,583
I love being beautiful!

322
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,903
You should give it a try!

323
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,563
Darwin asked me to give you this...

324
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:05,663
"Meet me at the stomach
destroyer roller coaster at 6PM".

325
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:08,863
Then he put three "X"s,
to show how extreme it will be!

326
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:11,923
It's a love letter!
He thinks you're a girl...

327
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:16,103
You'll give yourself worried
lines with all that nagging.

328
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,283
And you'll never be beautiful,

329
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:19,523
like me!

330
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,283
She came, she actually came!

331
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:30,323
Hey, you ready, Darwin?

332
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:31,923
She knows my name!

333
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,923
This is gonna be awesome!

334
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,383
Can't wait, can't wait,
can't wait, can't wait...!

335
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:41,183
I know this is kinda sudden,
and I hope you won't think I'm a fool.

336
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:43,283
Yeah, this is really cool!

337
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:44,783
But, who am I to deny fate?

338
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,483
I know! This is gonna be great!

339
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,143
What I really mean is...

340
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:50,983
What?

341
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,463
I love you.

342
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:59,263
So, now you see the real price of beauty.

343
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:02,643
Ah, he really thinks I'm a
girl and he thinks he love me!

344
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:06,683
You'll just have to tell him the
truth, won't you, beautiful?

345
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,783
I can't do that! He'll be heartbroken!

346
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:12,583
Besides, he might tell everyone about
the dress and I'll lose my powers!

347
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:16,027
But, maybe if I keep up
that, then in a few years

348
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,007
Darwin will move on
and meet another girl!

349
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,983
And if he doesn't?

350
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,883
I WANT MORE KIDS!

351
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:32,723
Who's your pretty friend, Anais?

352
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,103
It's me, dad...

353
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:35,783
Hello, "It's-me-dad"!

354
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,543
Is she foreign?

355
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,323
Hi, everyone!

356
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,583
This is quite difficult for me to say,

357
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:47,143
but what I'm trying to say is... is...

358
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:49,243
I'm leaving.

359
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,623
But, why?

360
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:56,023
Because the king of Europe
has been kidnapped...

361
00:19:56,843 --> 00:20:00,003
and they need my help
'cuz I'm so beautiful?

362
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:06,943
You better get on that bus
before you blow the whole thing!

363
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:08,623
Have you got the balloon?

364
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,223
Check!

365
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,983
This a great idea of yours.

366
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:14,983
Staging a grand farewell for
the darling of Elmore High!

367
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,983
Remember, this isn't about you!

368
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,083
Hey, everybody!

369
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,083
Here he comes! Quick, get on the bus!

370
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,543
This plan already reeks of failure.

371
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,723
What a perfect new girlfriend day!

372
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,863
Just for having a new girlfriend,
don't you think, fellas?

373
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:32,823
She is leaving?

374
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,243
Well, here it goes.

375
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,043
Hello, Darwin!

376
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,503
You get more beautiful
every time I see you.

377
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,123
But why are you leaving?

378
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:48,263
I'm sorry my love, but Europe needs me.

379
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,423
Then take me with you!

380
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,303
A love this special only comes
around once in a lifetime.

381
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:58,483
We must nurture it, take care of it,
let it grow and blossom like a... a... a...

382
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:00,823
A potato?

383
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:01,843
A potato!

384
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,623
You are a true poet, my love.

385
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:06,716
And although we'll never see
each other again, my heart and

386
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:10,047
all my other internal organs
will always belong to you.

387
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:11,703
All aboard!

388
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,703
I have to go now. Bus is leaving, bye!

389
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,223
She's an angel...

390
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,323
Look out for the Sun!

391
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,523
Go left! Go left!

392
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:45,583
NOOOOOOO!

393
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,943
Why? WHY?

394
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,943
Gumball, go to him.

395
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:57,523
I'm so sorry, Darwin.
She was really special.

396
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,286
But think of it this way,
it's better to have loved,

397
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,723
and watched that love be
burned before your very eyes,

398
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,723
than to have never loved at all.

399
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:09,872
So, why don't you and me head
home, cover ourselves in

400
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:12,523
ice cubes and jump from the
biggest set of stairs we can find.

401
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:13,703
What do you say, buddy?

402
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:17,703
Okay...

403
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:22,743
Excuse me.

404
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,483
I know this is a bit sudden.

405
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:29,583
I mean, we hardly know each
other, but, I think I love you.

406
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:34,343
Your silence says a thousand words.

407
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:38,003
I guess some people just can't
help making fools of themselves.

408
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:40,003
Look, there's Gumball!

409
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,403
And he's naked!

410
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:45,163
DON'T MOCK ME!

411
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,163
I used to be beautiful.
