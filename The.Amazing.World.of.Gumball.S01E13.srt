1
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,209
Class! Time to hand in your homework!

2
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,457
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

3
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,414
If we tell her the truth, she'll flip!

4
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:39,711
Be cool, buddy. It'll be fine.
At least it's on time.

5
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:43,270
I wasn't built to take this much pressure!
Relax, man.

6
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,562
We'll just tell her what really happened.

7
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:49,733
All right, you two.
What's<i> today's</i> excuse?

8
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,136
Our dad ate our homework. Rrrrrrrrrrr...

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,751
Go to the guidance counselor immediately!

10
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:57,508
But, miss simian...
and don't come back until

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,278
you've learned how to tell the truth!

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,917
And this is what the<i> inside</i>
of a liar looks like. Ewwww!

13
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,529
Notice the dark abyss here.

14
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:10,822
That's the corrupt soul of the liar.

15
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:13,592
But, Mr. small, we're not liars.

16
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:14,770
You should tell that to the last

17
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:18,386
boy that sat there and lied to me.
He's<i> there</i> now.

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,012
The prison?! No, next to it.
The cemetery!

19
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:24,437
What happened to him?
He just works there.

20
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,441
Now, let me show you something.

21
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:34,413
This is the lying hat.
Now, watch what happens when i

22
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:39,253
put it on. Your mother called.
She says she hates you.

23
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:44,992
She does? I think my heart just broke.
It's okay, kids.

24
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:48,863
That was a lie.
But, you see, that's what a lie

25
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:52,667
will do... hurt your feelings.
She hates you.

26
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:56,437
She loves you. Yay! >> Hates you!
Aww. >> Loves you. Yay!

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,483
Hates you. Loves you.
Hates you. Loves you.

28
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,542
Hatesyoulovesyouhatesyoulovesyou

29
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,387
hatesyoulovesyouhatesyoulovesyou

30
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,735
so, what have we learned today?
Never trust a man in

31
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,650
a hat. Yes, but what else?

32
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:12,288
Uhhhh... >> Honesty is the best policy.

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,059
Say it. Honesty is the best policy.
Good. And again.

34
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,862
Honesty is the best policy.
Honesty is the best policy.

35
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,999
Honesty is the best policy.
Honesty is the best policy...

36
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,556
Okay, Darwin.
Remember, from now on, we only

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,807
tell the truth. Okay.
Your face is too big.

38
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:33,844
Well, when you say "s,"
your gills whistle. You

39
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,624
smell so stinky,
sailors sing sea shanties about your

40
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,793
stinkyness! When you're asleep,

41
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,418
your face looks like this!
When you're awake,

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,355
your face looks like this!
You walk like a Princess!

43
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:48,248
You walk like a pigeon!
Okay. That's<i> us</i> covered.

44
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:52,908
Let's bring our honesty to the world.
You've got a

45
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,268
monobrow. You've got no hands.

46
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,538
Just being honest.
Your face is burnt. I love you.

47
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,463
But he'll never make the first move.
He's having a party

48
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,443
on Friday, and he didn't invite

49
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:04,844
you. >> What?! >> Sorry, man.

50
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:08,780
You're just not cool enough. Whoa-ho!

51
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,874
This one is<i> long</i> overdue. Hey, Tina?

52
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,300
You smell, and it's not very ladylike.
It's like a sweaty

53
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,725
watch strap. Nah, it's more like

54
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,616
raw chicken and rancid
milk in a plastic bag.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,331
Yeah...
that's been left in the sun for a week.

56
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,867
Okay,
now that we have your smelliness covered,

57
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:33,869
let's move on to your personality.
Yep. The truth hurts.

58
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,147
Nigel. Let's leave all this behind

59
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,370
and go and live on a desert island.

60
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:47,657
But how would we survive?
On fruit, water... And love.

61
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,769
Did you ask us in here for a reason?

62
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,973
Yes, of course, watterson.
I've been getting a lot of

63
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,264
complaints.
What on earth's gotten into you?

64
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:58,435
Principal brown, can i be honest with you?
i... y-yes.

65
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,903
I can't help thinking
that your relationship

66
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:03,395
with miss simian could
be compromising your

67
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,856
professionalism.
I completely agree, gumball.

68
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:08,746
And, frankly,
i fear my education is suffering as a

69
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,683
result.
And besides, principal brown, you could do

70
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,819
so-o-o much better than<i> that.</i> Rrrrrrrrrr!

71
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:18,857
Okay, so you got honesty wrong.

72
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,726
Perhaps we should try something else.

73
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:26,198
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
One second.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,261
Hello, children.
I'm the honesty bear. O-Kay.

75
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,576
I'm here to explain that
honesty's not all black and

76
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:40,447
white. But, like my fur,
it's more of a gray area.

77
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,250
Gray. See that? Gray fur.
Now, there<i> are</i> some things that

78
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,186
are "too" honest to say out

79
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,290
loud. Honesty bear, I'm confused.

80
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,924
What<i> can</i> we be honest about?

81
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:54,261
Let me put this in a language
you kids will understand...

82
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:59,367
hippity rap! H-h-h-h-honesty!!

83
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,204

call, depending on who you're

93
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,059
talking to and the context
of the conversation!

94
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:27,597
Any questions? No? Excellent! Goodbye.

95
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,868
Okay, i think i got it.
You should always tell the

96
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,792
truth, unless you have to lie,

97
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,715
but if you do lie, you should

98
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:33,637
tell the truth about it, unless

99
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,528
you're talking to someone who's

100
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,306
lying, because if they tell
a lie and you tell the truth,

101
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:37,242
it'll be a lie because you were

102
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,175
lying about telling the truth,

103
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,109
inside of a lie, so the whole

104
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:43,481
thing's a lie while still being true.

105
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:48,419
Man,
this "truth and honesty" thing is hard.

106
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:49,976
Has anyone seen the nurse?

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,502
I think my head may be on fire.
Is my head on fire?

108
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:57,463
Um... W-would it be a good thing or a

109
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:01,332
bad thing if it was on fire?
A bad thing, of course!

110
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,302
It's not on fire.

111
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,573
For a minute there,
i thought my head was on fire.

112
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:12,934
What a relief.
So, how are things with you,

113
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,016
watterson?...Yeah, not bad. You?

114
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,352
Pretty good, pretty good.
So, no more of that lying

115
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:26,994
trouble, i hope? No.
>> All right, then. Toodle-oo!

116
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:38,866
Hmmmm. Okay. Looks I'm gonna have to

117
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,375
introduce you to someone else.

118
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,969
I'd like you to say hello
to the silence snake.

119
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:52,981
Hello, si... silencessssssssss!
B... silencessssssss!

120
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,462
Now, i bet your tiny minds are thinking...
"But what if

121
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,149
there's something important

122
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,299
we need to say? "Well, why don't

123
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:07,805
you ask the silence snake? Go on.

124
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:14,092
He won't bite. O-Kay...
What... silencesssssss!

125
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:20,851
Well, it looks like my work here is done.
W-w-whoa!

126
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:28,854
Aah! Boys? Can you hear me?
Say something!

127
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:34,633
I think my knees are
digging into my back.

128
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:38,147
You need to help me.
Now, there should be a little,

129
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:44,377
gold key on my desk. Don't worry!
I've got it here. Gosh.

130
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,647
Please, no! Wait! Maybe i can just...

131
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,183
Aaaaah! Okay, you need to get some help

132
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:55,022
right now. Right now! Elmore police.

133
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:05,500
Hello? Hello?
I'm sick of these prank phone calls.

134
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:13,074
It's just not the same. What<i> now?</i>

135
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:23,185
What's that supposed to mean? Nyeah! Unh!

136
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,591
What?! Miss simian's trapped down the

137
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:31,761
old abandoned well?!

138
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:35,398
I'm coming, my smoochkins! Hup! Aaaah!

139
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:43,384
E-elbows, don't fail me now.
So, anyway, the plan is to

140
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:46,811
live on fruit, water, and love.
Dude, i don't care.

141
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,947
Well,
go back to fixing the toilets, then!

142
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:55,374
What do you want? Nyeah!
What?! I'm trapped down the old

143
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:00,726
abandoned well?! No! I'm coming! Aaaaah!

144
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:04,229
Come on, chin. don't fail me now.

145
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:09,611
Whoa-oa-oa!
Slow down, little dudes. What's that?

146
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:12,704
Mr. small rocked back smugly on

147
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:13,750
his chair, fell into the bottom

148
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:14,817
drawer of his filing cabinet,

149
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:15,908
it locked shut, and you want to

150
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,378
use these crowbars to break him out?

151
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Mmmmm. >> Aww. See ya!
Aah! Aah! Boys, i-i-is that you?

152
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,226
Do something! Anything!

153
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:35,877
Well, on the plus side, i think

154
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,965
that loosened the lock a little.

155
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:43,772
Keep going. Aah! Aah! Ooh! Aah!

156
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,244
Just a thought, but maybe you

157
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:51,646
want to lever the drawer
open with that crowbar.

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,389
Freeze! Police!

159
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:09,959
You're coming with me,
you little hooligans! But...

160
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:14,592
Why won't you talk? Talk, darn it! Talk!

161
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,051
Officer,
there's clearly been some kind of

162
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,409
misunderstanding.
Well, ma'am, looking at their

163
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,478
rap sheet, it seems they
are not first-time offenders.

164
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,048
Multiple counts of antisocial

165
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,117
behavior, vandalizing school property,
and setting their

166
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:30,599
principal on fire.
And all because you lied

167
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:34,492
about your father eating your homework.

168
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:44,696
Okay! I did it! Take me away! Why?

169
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:48,461
I thought it was gonna make me smart!

170
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,242
Well, it obviously didn't.

171
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:53,623
So,
i guess you boys didn't lie after all.

172
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,348
I'm so proud of you

173
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,618
two. Thanks, mom.
>> Um... One more thing.

174
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,375
You don't happen to know
where Mr. small is, do you?

175
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,261
The only clue we
could find was this sock.

176
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:13,022
Well. Case closed!
>> This isn't funny anymore!

177
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,336
Can somebody please open this thing?!

178
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:23,339
He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-l...

179
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,651
Bowls... check! Spoons...
check! Cereal... check!

180
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:08,654
So much for easy opening!
It looks so simple on TV!

181
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,697
Man, i really don't want to go to school

182
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,434
today. Me neither. Let's not go!

183
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:18,103
You can do that? Sure! Hey, dad?

184
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:22,396
Yes? We really don't
want to go to school today.

185
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,422
Why? Are you sick? Nah.
We're just not up for it. Yeah!

186
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:27,379
School is boring!

187
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,116
But you<i> have</i> to go to school.
You're kids!

188
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:34,387
It's what you do! Aw! Ooh!
Mailman! Whoo-hoo!

189
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,723
I wish we were grown-ups, like dad.

190
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,979
Then we'd never have to go to

191
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:40,560
school and nobody
would tell us what to do.

192
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:44,365
We could drive trucks,
stay up all night, vote.

193
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:51,294
Vote... Finally! What's that?
Why? According to the fifth

194
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:53,108
amendment, i don't have to
answer that without my lawyer

195
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:57,378
present! Right.
Anyway, about school... Yeah.

196
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,680
You're kids, so you do what mom

197
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:02,784
tells me to tell you to do.
Being a kid is wretched-lame.

198
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:05,453
You should be happy to be young.

199
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:09,057
Before you know it,
you'll be overweight, unattractive,

200
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:13,596
balding, middle-aged.
Take over breakfast!

201
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:18,101
I don't want you to see me like this!
What's<i> his</i> problem?

202
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,867
You never know with that guy.

203
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,838
Come on. Let's have breakfast.

204
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:27,511
Man, what a pile of beans.
Dude, watch your language!

205
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,979
You'll get us in trouble!
Well, I'm sorry,

206
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:34,118
Darwin, but it is.
It's a big, steaming pile of beans.

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,555
Gumball, look! A shooting star!
This is our chance.

208
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,559
Make a wish! I wish i was a grown-up.

209
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:49,561
Me too! They don't work at all.
Faker! Darn kids!

210
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:51,557
What do you think you're doing?!

211
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,071
Today's lesson will be about

212
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:56,909
the transformations of the human body.

213
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,022
As you get older, hormones

214
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,316
begin to change your appearance. Here.

215
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,629
It's me as an adult talking to

216
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:11,758
my secretary over the intercom.
It's me voting! Awesome.

217
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,695
Passing notes, are we? No, miss simian.

218
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:19,232
Well, then, what's this?
That's us as adults?

219
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,337
I guess you're on topic, then.
Anyway, pimples...

220
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,140
Ew! Silence! Actually, it's pretty gross.

221
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:32,113
You may continue. Ewwwwww!
Pimples, or acne, can pop up

222
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,384
at any time...
Dude, what's that on your face?

223
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:39,321
What? What?! That. What?! It looks like a

224
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,857
greasy, yellow egg.
No, no, actually, it's more like

225
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:44,960
a small volcano with a sweaty golf ball.
Do something!

226
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:49,164
Do something! Okay, okay.
Hold on. Let me just, um...

227
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:55,939
I think we're gonna

228
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,575
need more little hats.
Aaaah! Relax, dude!

229
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:01,511
That's easy for<i> you</i> to say!
Why don't<i> you</i> have any?

230
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:09,514
Just lucky, i guess. Aaah!
Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Ew!

231
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,826
I think that's all of them.
What's happening to us?

232
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,597
I think we've got the plague.
Do you have any

233
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,133
other symptoms?
My top lip feels a little silky.

234
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:25,804
Next comes the appearance
of hair on the body and face.

235
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:28,907
Dude, you look like an undercover cop.

236
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:33,079
Stop laughing! Do something! Okay.

237
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:39,852
I see mom do this all the time.
And dad, on one occasion.

238
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:43,890
That feels so much bet... aaaaaah!

239
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:49,841
Aah! don't worry, dude.
I'm not worried about <i>me!</i>

240
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:53,144
I'm worried about<i> you!</i>
You look like a baby werewolf!

241
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:59,139
No! Not me!
It was better when it was just you!

242
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:01,810
Guys, i don't mean to interrupt,
but this is the

243
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:05,747
girls' toilet. Yeah, sorry!
I got to sort this out.

244
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:09,750
Start chewing. Okay, settle down.

245
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,786
Everyone, get into your team for

246
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:19,395
dodgeball. No. Not dodgeball.
You're going down.

247
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:28,548
You get the idea. Please...
not above the should...

248
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:36,572
aah! Aah! Aah! The ear!
My ankle! Aah! A bowling ball?!

249
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:45,617
Catch! Enough!

250
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:11,478
Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!
This is horrible! We're monsters!

251
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,623
No, you're not. It's just a part of life.

252
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,026
Are you saying we're grown-ups now?
Apparently so.

253
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:23,028
Did you hear that?
That shooting star worked.

254
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:26,022
Now, get back to class!
All right, miss simian.

255
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:31,027
Wait a minute!
We don't have to listen to you anymore.

256
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,072
Because we're men!

257
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:36,454
♪ We're gonna test-drive a car ♪

258

00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,028

00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:10,747
wait. No, we can't.
We don't have any money.

272
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:15,551
Let's get jobs! Well, as far as i can see

273
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:17,988
from your... Résumé, you have

274
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,791
absolutely no qualifications whatsoever.

275
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:24,172
Do either of you have
any applicable skills?

276
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,531
Well, i can do<i> this.</i>

277
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,926
Look, for the third time,
Mr. watterson, rolling your

278
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,174
stomach is not a valuable
skill in the work environment.

279
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,134
I-I'm sorry. Point taken. Good.

280
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,849
Okay, so, looking at your track re...

281
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:47,554
I see. Sorry. Look, right now, i need you

282
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:48,933
to give me a valid reason why i

283
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:51,758
should even consider
giving either of you a job.

284
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,671
Well, i can touch my nose with my tongue.

285
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:59,164
That's not a skill. <i>This</i> is.
You guys want a job?

286
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:04,438
Well, you can have<i> mine!</i>
I quit! Good luck!

287
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,209
Yay! What do people with jobs do?

288
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:11,545
I don't know. Hiring and firing? Cool!

289
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:15,016
Well, you're hired. So are you! What now?

290
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:18,353
Guess we should do some firing?
You're fired!

291
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,656
You're fired! You're fired! You're fired!

292
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:24,559
And you're fired!
Hey, what are you firing<i> me</i> for?

293
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:29,164
It's what i do. Well,<i> you're</i> fired!
You can't fire me!

294
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,968
I just fired<i> you!</i>
All right, quickly, hire me again.

295
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:39,252
Okay. You're hired.
You're fired! I can't believe

296
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:41,944
we lost our jobs. So, this is being an

297
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:46,094
adult? No money. No job.
Crumbly apartment.

298
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,919
Rent overdue! And this is our last

299
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,722
piece of food.
I think we should share it.

300
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,758
Sorry. What was that? I can't believe you

301
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,048
ate our last piece of candy!
Well, i can't

302
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,153
believe I'm stuck here with you!
I can't believe we're

303
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:01,978
both yelling! I know!
We're trying to hide from the

304
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,935
landlord! Let's be quiet, then!

305
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:09,674
Okay! I wish we were kids again. Me too.

306
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:14,213
I'll be in my room. Me too.

307
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,721
Someone's coming! No!

308
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:25,992
It's the landlord! What are we gonna do?

309
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,796
I don't know! Unh! Uhhhh! Uhhhhhh!

310
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:35,442
Aaaaah! Please don't hurt us!
Take anything you want!

311
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:39,618
Guys, it's me... your sister.
Dude, you look like

312
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:43,555
a Mexican wrestler.
I'm not a man, and neither are you.

313
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:46,514
I think i know what happened. Follow me.

314
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:54,517
Come on. Stay up. Stay up!
Yes! No! Now, come on!

315
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:59,884
Flex! Flex, flex! Richard?
What are you doing?

316
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:03,599
I'm getting old.
It's like you always say...

317
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:06,801
"we grow up so fat."
"Fast," Richard, and i

318
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,117
was talking about the children.
Don't talk to me

319
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:13,543
about those rosy-cheeked, baby-faced...
Hairy mutants!

320
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:17,969
Hi. What's happened to my babies?
It's okay, mom.

321
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,483
I think it was these
that turned us into men.

322
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:23,654
You found my supplements.
But they're empty.

323
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:27,658
Can someone please tell
me what's going on? Sure.

324
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,705
At breakfast, dad left with
the cereal box, so we ate his

325
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:35,777
supplements by mistake.
I think i know what happened.

326
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,670
Yeah, i just told you.
Richard, why on earth

327
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,939
were you buying those supplements?

328
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:44,519
I couldn't help myself.
It's the Internet's fault.

329
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:46,344
Every time i open my e-mails,

330
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,481
this is what i get. <i>Are you too fat?</i> Yes.

331
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,718
<i>Are you too bald?</i> Maybe.
<i>Are you really the man she</i>

332
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,133
<i>deserves?</i> No!
So,<i> that's</i> where all the laptops went.

333
00:21:57,157 --> 00:22:02,783
It was a moment of weakness,
and i crumbled, Nicole!

334
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:09,203
I crumbled!
Honey, you didn't need those pills.

335
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:15,256
I love you just the way you are.
So do we, dad. Really?

336
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:19,522
Come here, my little... Body builders.

337
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:23,451
So, are we gonna be like this forever?
It says on the box

338
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,720
that the effect wears off after a week.

339
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:29,290
At least that pyramid
scheme will be more reliable.

340
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,471
Anyway, now this is all cleared up,
let's all get out

341
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,096
the house and have some fun.

342
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:47,076
Higher! Higher!
They grow up so fast. Precious mo...
