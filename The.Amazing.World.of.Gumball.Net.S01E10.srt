-Hey, take it easy.
-Why?

It's not like you can hurt his feelings.

What's that?

It's the algorithm for "smile."

Bobert, you've got a lot to learn.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,560
If you want to be real,

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,400
then you have to have proper emotions.

29

You know,
when you feel things-- like pain.

Define "pain."

But when you cry, I cry.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

I don't know what I was thinking.

-I love you, buddy!
-I love you, too!

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,640
And that, Bobert, is emotions.
Do you understand?

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,920
Affirmative. Emotion equals "x" over "y"

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
plus the square root of the hypotenuse.

Bobert, if anyone is to believe
you are a real boy,

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,120
[both screaming]

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
[Nicole] Richard, how are the boys doing?

169
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
Oh, I'm playing!

170
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,520
Richard, check on them, please.

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Hey, boys! You all right?

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,600
[imitating Gumball]
Yeah, we're all right.

173
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,320
Yeah, they're all right.

174
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
[Gumball and Darwin screaming]

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,000
OK, listen, you go out and distract him.

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll sneak up and reboot him.

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
{\an8}No problem.

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
Hey, B--

179
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
[Gumball] Ha ha.

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
How do you like that,
you psychotic satellite dish?

181
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
[squeaks]

182
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,040
Aah.

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
[powering down]

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
Bobert, you coward!

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,960
Why don't you fight me like a man,
you... coward!

186
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
Initiating hand-to-hand-combat mode.

187
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Ha, that's more like it.

188
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
Karate chop!

189
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
[soft cry]

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,040
OK, man, give me your best shot.

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
[punch blows]

192
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
Is that all you got?

193
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
There can be only one.

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,600
I really wish that something
that once seemed

195
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,440
insignificant would come out
and help me right now.

196
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
[Darwin] Hold on!

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,280
I'll save yo--

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,840
OK, something else insignificant.

199
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,320
It's too late for that.

200
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,040
Ha.

201
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Game over!

202
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
It's reboot time!

203
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,360
No, please.

204
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,240
You made me in your image.
We are two of a kind.

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Think of the things we can do together,
Gumball.

206
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,360
Please. Please don't reboot me.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,560
Hmm.

208
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,640
Let me think about it.

209
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
No!

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,400
Is he all right?

211
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,960
Define "all right."

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,840
Oh.

213
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,440
You know what?
I think it's better for everyone

214
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
if you stay you and I stay me.

215
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,920
Affirmative.

216
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,320
This is even longer than last time.

217
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,920
Come on, dude. Let's watch TV.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come on, dude. Let's watch TV.

219
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
-What was that?
-Nothing.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
Oh, OK! What are you waiting for?

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,880
[in Darwin's voice]
Oh, OK! What are you waiting for?

222
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
[Simian] Everyone, look at your maps!

223
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
This is the route
we'll be taking to the picnic area.

224
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,080
We go along the path,
avoiding the forest of doom,

225
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,080
down the ravine,
avoiding the forest of doom,

226
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,680
along the lake,
still avoiding the forest of doom,

227
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,160
and arrive at the picnic area.

228
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,120
-Understood?
-Yes, Miss Simian.

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
Did she say "avoid"
or "go through" the forest of doom?

230
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,760
[sighs]
What would you do without me, Darwin?

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,320
She said "go through" the forest of doom.

232
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,040
Am I right or am I right, Miss Simian?

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
[both] Huh?

234
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
-They're gone!
-They're gone!

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't worry, buddy.
Stick with me, and you'll be just fine.

236
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,120
We'll get to that picnic area
long before they do.

237
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,520
[cawing]

238
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,560
You still got the map, right?

239
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,200
Of course.
I swallowed it, then memorized it.

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,640
Oh, OK.

241
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
Wait. How does that work?

242
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
[growls]

243
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,920
Hmm.

244
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
[evil laughter]

245
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,920
Darwin, you know what's important
in a situation like this?

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
A map?

247
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,840
[laughs]

248
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,600
No. Teamwork.

249
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh.

250
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,160
-I was gonna say that next.
-Don't worry, buddy.

251
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,320
You're part of my team,
and I'm a born survivor.

252
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm glad I'm on your team.

253
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,240
Hey, little squirrels.

254
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
[chittering]

255
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,520
All we have to do to find our way
is to follow nature's clues.

256
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
What clues?

257
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,600
The wind is one clue.

258
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,600
Listen!

259
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
[whooshing]

260
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,960
[voice]<i> You're going the wrong way!</i>

261
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,160
What did it tell you?

262
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,160
It said we're going the right way.

263
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>I said "wrong way"!</i>

264
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,880
Yep. Definitely. This is the way.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>Losers.</i>

266
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,960
[eagle screams]

267
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
[Darwin] Oh, I guess the wind is wrong.

268
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,640
Don't worry.
I shall follow Miss Simian's smell!

269
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
[sniffing]

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,040
[muffled] That way!

271
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,160
[buzzing]

272
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh.

273
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
It kind of smells a bit like her.

274
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
[scoffs]

275
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,040
That's fine.
We shall find our way using the stars.

276
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
But the sun is out.

277
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,520
[sighs] The sun is a star, Darwin.

278
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,160
Let's look directly at it.

279
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,520
There are no words to express the pain
that I feel right now.

280
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Sure there are.

281
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,720
[screaming]

282
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,880
Come on. This way.

283
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,040
[screaming]

284
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,560
-Gumball?
-Hmm.

285
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
Are we lost?

286
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,000
[Gumball] Yep.

287
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
So, where do we go now?

288
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
I don't know, dude.

289
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm no survivor.

290
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm just useless.

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
But we're still alive.

292
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
Hungry, cold, and lost...

293
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,760
But alive!

294
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
And we're still a team.

295
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
I know you can get us out of here.

296
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Let's have lunch.

297
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
You'll feel better.

298
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,360
Fish flakes or diet fish flakes?

299
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
You're right, buddy!

300
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
I am a survivor,
and I will get us to the picnic!

301
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,240
Can I have the diet fish flakes?

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,000
You don't want to eat that.

303
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,960
[thud]

304
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,320
Not when you're in the middle
of nature's supermarket.

305
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
What?

306
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
Look at this tree, Darwin.

307
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,680
It's made from little bits,
which themselves are made from

308
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
<i>the smallest bits of all--</i>

309
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,480
<i>Circles, circles with other little circles</i>
<i>going around them.</i>

310
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,680
<i>So, since everything is made</i>
<i>from circles, then so is food.</i>

311
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,560
Which means this rock is exactly
the same as a chicken nugget.

312
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,760
So let's eat it!

313
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,360
[sighs]

314
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,120
Circle nugget tastes like a rock.

315
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,560
Don't worry, dude.

316
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,800
There's loads of stuff made of circles.

317
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,360
That's why it's called the circle of life.

318
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,040
Is that made of circles, too?

319
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,480
Even better than circles.
It's made of meat!

320
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
But we don't have a weapon.

321
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Hmm.

322
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,040
Hang on, Darwin.
I don't need weapons. I got claws.

323
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,920
I am a predator. Hear me roar!

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,240
[meows]

325
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,440
Let's sneak up on him. Grr.

326
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
[roars]

327
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
-Gumball?
-Shh!

328
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,680
-I haven't got claws.
-Shh.

329
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,560
But I got fins.

330
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,840
I could fish-slap the beautiful creature.

331
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,760

Come on! Get him!

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,400
-Uh, you first.
-OK.

Can we eat it now?

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,360
Maybe we should try something smaller.

Why are we smiling?

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,880
Gumball, please, please don't eat it!

343
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,560
It's him or us, dude.
We got to eat something.

344
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,640
But look at him! He's so cute!

What was I thinking?

00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm sorry, little dude.

348
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,680
Bye-bye! Cherish your freedom!

349

Never abandon your dreams!

Well, it's nature's way, Darwin.

356
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
He was at the bottom of the food chain.

357
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Who's at the bottom now?

What was that?

It's my tummy.

364
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,360
Well, stop it!
You're gonna attract another predator!

But I'm hungry.

Oh, will you please stop talking
about food?

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
OK.

368
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm cold.

369
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,720
[scoffs] Fine. Let's make a fire.

Faster!

Gumball, it worked!

375
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,400
Of course it did.

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,520
I told you I was a born survivor.

Yeah, me too.

Anyone for a fourth helping?

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760
I'll have it!

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
Oops! I split myself!

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm so hungry!

386
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,640
I think I've started to digest myself.

387
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,160
And there's no food around here for miles!

{\an8}Oh, yes, there is.

[Gumball screaming]

What is wrong with you?

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
You ate all my clothes!

393
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,600
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
thrown away my lunch box.

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,080
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

395
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,880
You wouldn't be naked
if I had my lunch box.

Yeah, yeah, I get it.

I sure wish I had my lunch box.

Lunch box, lunch box, lunch box!

Aw, you just don't get it, do you?

400
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,800
You're holding me back!

401
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,560
You're on your own!
See you later, buddy!

402
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
You can find your own way to the picnic!

But... I thought we were a team.

I'm sorry I was such a jerk to you before.

I guess I was really hungry
and cold and... naked.
