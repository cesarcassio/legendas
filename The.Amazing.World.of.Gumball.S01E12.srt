1
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:36,906
Is that you, tooth fairy?

2
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:40,109
Aaaah! It's a ghost!

3
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,044
It's a ghost! It's a gho...

4
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,893
Mom! I need more!
- But that's your fifth

5
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:01,297
Well, it's because, i-I'm... Growing?

6
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,534
Well, could you try and grow slower?
This is costing me a fortune.

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,405
Thanks. Richard,
what are you doing in the cupboard?

8
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:12,908
Shhhh! I'm hiding from the ghost.
This house is haunted!

9
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,845
Okay. Heh. I'm closing the door now.

10
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:19,814
Thanks, mom.

11
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:27,589
What are you doing?
Follow me and all will be revealed.

12
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:33,228
I have got something amazing to show you.

13
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,166
Whoa! A sheet! No, Darwin.
Something even better.

14
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:41,903
Mr. Robinson? Yep.
I found him in the shed, so i

15
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:43,966
put him up here in the attic, where I've

16
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,507
provided him with full en suite dining,
unlimited

17
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,102
beverages, and a queen-size bed.
Anais: You

18
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:51,779
do realize what keeping
a 50-year-old man in

19
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:56,117
these conditions is called?
Love? Kidnapping.

20
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,887
- And i want nothing more to do with it.
- Don't worry,

21
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:04,392
- Mr. Robinson. <i>We</i> will never abandon you.
- What was he doing in

22
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,295
the shed? Gumball: I don't know.
He hasn't said a word since i

23
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:10,531
He looks kind of... Broken.

24
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:14,802
It's okay, Mr. Robinson.
I know just what will cheer you

25
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:21,643
up. And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for tonight only, i give you...

26
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,645
Me! Darwin: Whoa!

27
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:29,183
This guy's good! Gumball: Ho-okay, okay.
Now, what do you call... This?!

28
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:37,825
That's right... a pea on a fork.

29
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:45,033
His head is the pea. His head is the pea!

30
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,268
And now, what's

31
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:55,209
this?! It's a butt... In an elevator.

32
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:14,262
Why? Wh-h-h-y?!

33
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:17,999
Wh-h-h-h-h-h-h-y?! Dad: Aaah!

34
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:23,871
E-e-e-nough! You can ruin my sleep,
you can terrorize my family,

35
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:28,240
but you will not stop me
from eating my sausage!

36
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,711
Cheer up,

37
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:33,114
Mr. Robinson. You know what
i do when I'm feeling a bit low?

38
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:35,116
I look at this.

39
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:43,290
Hey! Look what i found! ♪ electrofat ♪

40
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,293
♪ get you fit while you watch
TV ♪ i think this may help.

41
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,396
It says here "promotes health and
happiness. Side effects may include

42
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,202
electrocution, hair loss,
hair gain, depression,

43
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,733
euphoria, blackouts, amnesia," blah blah

44
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:56,603
blah blah blah... aha! "Gets results fast"!
- Well, this is exactly

45
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,172
Okay, now power it up.

46
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:01,475
Look! He's moving!

47
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:04,544
It's working!

48
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,681
He's asking for more! Turn it up!

49
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:12,085
He's smiling! He's smiling!

50
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:17,190
Richard, what are you

51
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:20,594
doing... aaah! Dad: Aah! Nicole! Nicole!

52
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:24,531
Nicole! Where are you?!
Nicole!! Mom: I'm here.

53
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,454
Richard, can you tell me
why I'm hanging upside-down?

54
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,769
Because this place is

55
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:32,539
haunted, and i need to set more traps!

56
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:36,977
Does he look happy?
- Nah, he looks more

57
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,646
like a bulldog staring at the sun.
don't you think?

58
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:43,417
Yeah. Let's try to remember the last

59
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,120
time he looked happy. Yeah.
That was the day you learned how

60
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,089
to tie your shoelaces.

61
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,663
It hurts!

62
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:10,577
The smile on his face.
I'll treasure that memory forever.

63
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:15,816
That's it, Darwin. He finds
happiness in the suffering of others.

64
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:20,420
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Hey, Mr. Robinson.

65
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,089
Look at this.

66
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:28,128
It's funny 'cause it hurts!
Right, Mr. Robinson?

67
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,065
You have to put more heart into it.
Like this!

68
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:39,072
Ooh! Unh!

69
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:41,828
Richard, honey,
can you help me down, please?

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,343
Don't you understand?!

71
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:49,015
We're at war! I've already lost one
sausage, and i will not lose another one.

72
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:53,019
- But who are you fighting?
- The ghost, of course!

73
00:05:53,021 --> 00:06:00,060
Hey, Mr. Robinson, look.

74
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:03,396
Is he smiling yet?
- Nope.

75
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:06,199
Richard. Richard! Please look at me!
- First he takes my

76
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,436
sausages, and then what? Should i let him
take my wife? A man's house is his castle,

77
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,637
Nicole. And this is a castle,
and I'm not letting him ruin it.

78
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,677
There's a phantom in our bed,
and before you know it...

79
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,573
Richard, by all means,

80
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,429
be hysterical,
but please don't forget to breathe.

81
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,577
A giant earwig!

82
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,714
And the next thing you know,
he'll come for the kids... the

83
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,949
kids!
Mom: There are no such things as ghosts.

84
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,436
Richard, calm down.
Dad:<i> You</i> calm down, Nicole!

85
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:27,853
Richard, please don't...

86
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:33,392
Margaret and i used to argue like that...
sometimes up to six

87
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:39,565
times a day, from first thing in
the morning until last thing at night.

88
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:44,089
In the kitchen,
in the backyard, in the car,

89
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:49,341
occasionally, we'd do it in public,
once even while

90
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,146
- we were sleeping.
- But what happened?

91
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:59,285
I don't know. Something changed.
And one day, she said the spark

92
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:02,655
had gone and asked me to leave.

93
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,497
- That's when you found me in the shed.
- So<i> that's</i> what's

94
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,934
wrong with Mr. Robinson.
He lost his anger. Look!

95
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,637
- Yeah, that looks more like it.
- We're gonna sort

96
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,540
this out. How? Gumball: Leave that to us.

97
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,844
- But first, we got to get you out of here.
- Breathe in, breathe out.

98
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:30,349
Breathe in, breathe out.
Are you sure about this?

99
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,352
Don't worry. You're in safe hands. Ready?

100
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:37,556
- Breathe in, breathe... aaaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

101
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:42,127
Enough!

102
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:49,435
Heh!

103
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:53,806
I'm not sure what he sees in that woman,
but anyway...

104
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:58,010
Come on, Mr. Robinson!
Let's show her you still got it!

105
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:05,484
Okay, now go ballistic. I can't, kids.
I'm not that man anymore.

106
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:10,489
Then we'll do it for you.

107
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,927
Hey, you! Mr. Robinson's wife!
Come and have an argument with him!

108
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,530
I mean... Me! We're gonna have a fight,
and you're gonna like it!

109
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:22,468
Ha! How do you like my arguing,
See how angry i am?!

110
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:31,310
Wanna make out?

111
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:38,417
You made it worse. I didn't think it
was possible, but you made it worse.

112
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,187
Waaah! The ghost!
He's about to attack the

113
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,591
- children! Aaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaah!

114
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:52,263
This is for attacking my kids!
And this... Is... For... My...

115
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,532
- Sausage! Gumball: Dad!
- Now get out of my

116
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,634
garden! Gumball: Stop it!
It's Mr. Robinson!

117
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:01,005
Sorry!

118
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:19,857
Uuuuuuuuuuugh!
Dad: Show yourself, ghost of Mr. Robinson!

119
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:26,531
Hey, what's up, neighbor?

120
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:32,236
I've had enough of this family!
Your tacky lifestyle, your ugly

121
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:38,576
house, your cheap garden shed!
I'll smash it to pieces!

122
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,085
It's more solid than i thought.
But this is what i do to your

123
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,322
unfashionable deck chairs! Unh! Uggh!

124
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,159
Gosh darn it! And as for your crummy

125
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:02,500
thrift store vacuum cleaner buy cheap...
Buy twice!

126
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:10,502
And this is what i think
of your $2 clip-on tie!

127
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:19,851
I'm back! And as for you...

128
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:26,390
Yay! Welcome back, Mr. Robinson!

129
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,861
So, since we saved your
marriage and everything, i

130
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,864
guess that makes us best friends forever?
- So can we call you

131
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:40,338
gaylord instead of Mr. Robinson? don't
push it, kid. Now, take me home, woman.

132
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,545
What was that all about?
Well, there never was a ghost, dad.

133
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,481
- It was Mr. Robinson.
- We hid him in the attic.

134
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,886
No. I mean, what's wrong with our house,
our shed, and my tie?

135
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,655
Dad, you know what i do when i

136
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,859
feel like a loser? I look at this.

137
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,962
Yeah. I feel better now.

138
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,099
W-who does he think he is, anyway?

139
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,235
"$2 clip-on tie."
At least i know how to treat my wife!

140
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:16,506
Unh!

141
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:20,477
Aaaaah! Richard!!

142
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:00,150
How can you take Darwin away from us?

143
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,843
Well,
it seems he scored 100% on his aptitude

144
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,088
test. This has never happened before,

145
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,693
so i had to tell the government. Gumball:
The government? Yes, they want to test him

146
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,997
out, study his brain, probe it,
dissect it... that kind of thing.

147
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,034
<i>Please resolve the following
equation using the marker pen</i>

148
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:23,874
Hmmmm.

149
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:28,311
It's best they take him away.
He'd make the rest of you feel

150
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,680
I guess he's got a point.

151
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:34,784
So, you put clever people in quarantine
like they're some sort of contagious

152
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:39,022
pathological disease?
Maybe there's more than one

153
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:43,326
What i meant was...

154
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:47,244
Phbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbhhhttt! ♪ la, la,

155
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:51,568
la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la ♪

156
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,574
phbt! Phbt! Phbt! Apparently not.

157
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,411
What makes you think I'll
let you take away my son?

158
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,048
Well, technically, you're not his parents.
He's registered as a...

159
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,718
Richard, what are we going to do?

160
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,392
Get a new pet fish?
Dad: I'll save you, my little fish boy!

161
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,795
Mr. watterson,
that is a stationary closet.

162
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:24,534
- Can we visit him?
- Are you saying we'll

163
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:28,605
- never see Darwin again?
- Then<i> I'll</i> go with

164
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:34,277
him by proving i am a genius, too!

165
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:42,151
I need to become intelligent right now!

166
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:48,157
Quick, gumball...
to the liberray! The libararara!

167
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,395
The... Libarium?
The place where all the nerds hang out.

168
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:59,501
I had so much more love to give!
- No one will ever be able

169
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:03,439
- to replace him. Hey, dudes.
- Hi, rocky.

170
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:07,209
What's with the suitcase?
I kind of got rent

171
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:13,015
troubles, and i don't want to stay at my
parents'. Hey! Can i crash at your place?

172
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:15,417
Please?

173
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:20,122
Oooh!
Gumball: I got to find something that

174
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:25,928
Will make me smart.
What do you reckon, Darwin?

175
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,631
Look... salsola collina,

176
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,935
more commonly known as Russian thistle,
wind witch, or, if

177
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:36,038
you're really stupid, a tumbleweed.

178
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,377
That's it! I need a bigger head.

179
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:49,018
Inconceivable.
Maths will always hold a special

180
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,253
place in my timetable.

181
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,589
Greetings, fellow crusader of knowledge.

182
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,290
What's<i> your</i> favorite subject?

183
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,495
Calculus?

184
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,663
Trigonometry?

185
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:04,266
Come on. Spit it out.

186
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:10,439
That guy is such a

187
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:14,743
gluteus Maximus.

188
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,613
Hey, bobert. Whatcha doin'?
I'm on the Internet, the

189
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:21,984
largest source of knowledge in the world.
Why don't you get connected?

190
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,621
Hi. Hello? Is that the Internet?

191
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:30,359
You need to click the icon.
Gumball: Ooh, you need to click the icon.

192
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:34,496
Which one is the icon?
Dude, it's the only thing on

193
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:38,033
- I - knew that.

194
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:41,537
Whoooooooa!

195
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,974
It's beautiful! I can feel it!

196
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:52,514
I'm totally learning
somethi-ing-ing-ing-ing-ing!

197
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:59,054
What... Happened?
Your memory could not cope.

198
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:02,157
- You crashed. I had to reboot you.
- Come on!

199
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,693
There's got to be<i> something</i> in
this library making people smart.

200
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:11,332
This is such a great<i> book!</i>
I'd like to borrow this<i> book,</i> please.

201
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,367
Book? Book book book! Book book!

202
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,902
Oooh.

203
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:18,172
That's it! They're all watching books.

204
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:27,248
Hey. Shh! Gumball: Hey!

205
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,550
Shhhh! Gumball: Hey! Shhhhhhhh!

206
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:33,054
I think my book is broken.
I've been watching it for ages,

207
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:36,724
and I'm still not smart.
You don't watch books. You<i> read</i> them.

208
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,660
Shh! People are trying to work.

209
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:49,697
Okay, brain, let's get reading.
Once... U-pon... A... Ti-i-i-me...

210
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,609
that's it. I'm out of here.
I've had enough. I'm off to watch TV.

211
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:58,546
Hey! Where do you think<i> you're</i> going?
I didn't sign up for this.

212
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,883
I quit! Gumball: You can't quit.
There's no way I'm gonna pass a

213
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:07,021
test without a brain. Please.
I need you. We'll never pass.

214
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:11,559
Then...
then I'm going to make you smart, like

215
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:16,097
Darwin! >><i> sir? You appear to have a bit</i>

216
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,065
<i>of... Ink on your face.</i>

217
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:22,268
Are you sure there's
nothing else you want, honey?

218
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,304
Ask for anything.

219
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:26,641
Well, can i have two cans of soda?
- Quick, Richard... the

220
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:29,977
fridge! And some jelly beans.

221
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:35,016
But only the yellow ones!
Dad: Okay! Are you sure there's

222
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:39,187
- nothing else to wear, Mrs. watterson?
- Please, honey... you can

223
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:44,892
- call us "mom" and "dad."
- Read it! I can't!

224
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:48,563
Read it! So difficult! don't make me!

225
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:54,302
Aren't you tired of being so useless?
Years and years of insults and

226
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:58,105
abuse. Remember... Another "f" for you,

227
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:01,709
pea brain! Doofus! Loser!

228
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:09,083
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Then prove it.

229
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,953
- Hyah!
- This may take a

230
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:16,591

- I want to take the

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,755
aptitude test!
You don't have the brain of a

243
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,357
- genius, watterson.
- We'll see about that.

244
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,229
Come on, brain...
show principal brown what you can do.

245
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:34,934
What the... what is wrong with you?!

246
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,970
I meant do an equation or something.

247
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:41,775
Sorry.

248
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:48,815
I always pictured it a little smaller.
I've been working out.

249
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:55,055
Hey, dudes, want some popcorn?
Dad, can i borrow mom's car

250
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:58,124
tonight? Dad: Sure, son.
Anything you like.

251
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:02,462
Man, my dad is a righteous dude.

252
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:10,070
Mom? What's going on here?
- .

253
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:14,074
Well, this is your new brother...
rockwin. 'Sup?

254
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,710
You're kidding, right?
- Come on.

255
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:24,184
Let's just all give it a try.
Just for a moment.

256
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:27,821
It's not working! You're right. It's not.

257
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:33,059
Just a minute! No, it's not working.

258
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:38,164
I miss Darwin so much!

259
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:47,173
- All right! It was me!
- What? - It was me who filled

260
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:51,644
out Darwin's aptitude test. I found it on
the TV guide. I should be the one who gets

261
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,547
So Darwin's not a genius?

262
00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:00,620
Darwin!

263
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:04,256
Hello. We believe this is yours.

264
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:07,659
- Yay! Welcome back, buddy.
- We missed you so much.

265
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,863
- Don't ever go away again.
- What a conveniently

266
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:15,100
happy ending. Not so fast.

267
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:19,338
Hey! I said it was a happy ending!
You still owe us one genius.

268
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,975
What do you mean? Well,
it's obvious<i> he</i> didn't take that test.

269
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:27,012
But someone in this house did,
and this warrant says that

270
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:32,117
we get to take that person away.
Who is it?

271
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:40,793
<i>I</i> know who it is.

272
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:44,062
Be quiet! don't listen to him.
He's insane in the membrane.

273
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,465
- Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't!

274
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,134
You're stupid! We've established that!
Let the brain speak.

275
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,714
Sorry. The person who took the test

276
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:07,886
was...
H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h... him!

277
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:09,888
Rocky? Me?

278
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,693
Yeah, i took that test.

279
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:18,130
Then get your suitcase.
You're coming to the research center.

280
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:21,867
What, you mean, like, for free?
Well, of course.

281
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:25,771
Definitely beats my parents' place.
And I'm gonna need a hot

282
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:29,238
tub, too... 'cause i do most
of my thinking in the bath.

283
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,409
See ya, rocky!

284
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,044
Bye, rocky! So long!

285
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,812
That was really smart, brain.

286
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:36,281
Darwin's back home. Can i come home, too?

287
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:40,052
Are you kidding me?
Get in there, little dude. Whoo-hoo!

288
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:45,657
High five! Ha! And a pepperoni pizza?

289
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,594
Then<i> will you solve the equation?</i>
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:50,562
After my pedicure.
